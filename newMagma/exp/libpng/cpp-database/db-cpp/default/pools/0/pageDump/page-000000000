       * new low-order bits.
       *//* converts gray-scale components to 1..0 from 0..1 *//* expands the tRNS chunk in files without alpha *//* expands grayscale PNG files to RGB, or RGBA *//* expands PLTE PNG files to RGB (no tRNS) or RGBA (tRNS) *
       * Note that the 'EXPAND' transform does lots of different things: *//* reverses the order of low-bit-depth components packed into a byte *//* unpacks low-bit-depth components into 1 byte per component on read,
       * reverses this on write.
       *//* removes the alpha channel if present *//* drops the bottom 8 bits when bit depth is 16 *//* List ALL the PNG_TRANSFORM_ macros here.  Check for support using the READ
    * macros; even if the transform is supported on write it cannot be tested
    * without the read support.
    *//* the transform was tested somewhere *//* i.e. true-color depths *//* absent = gray, no alpha *//* If a transform is valid on both read and write this implies that if the
 * transform is applied to read it must also be applied on write to produce
 * meaningful data.  This is because these transforms when performed on read
 * produce data with a memory format that does not correspond to a PNG format.
 *
 * Most of these transforms are invertible; after applying the transform on
 * write the result is the original PNG data that would have would have been
 * read if no transform were applied.
 *
 * The exception is _SHIFT, which destroys the low order bits marked as not
 * significant in a PNG with the sBIT chunk.
 *
 * The following table lists, for each transform, the conditions under which it
 * is expected to do anything.  Conditions are defined as follows:
 *
 * 1) Color mask bits required - simply a mask to AND with color_type; one of
 *    these must be present for the transform to fire, except that 0 means
 *    'always'.
 * 2) Color mask bits which must be absent - another mask - none of these must
 *    be present.
 * 3) Bit depths - a mask of component bit depths for the transform to fire.
 * 4) 'read' - the transform works in png_read_png.
 * 5) 'write' - the transform works in png_write_png.
 * 6) PNG_INFO_chunk; a mask of the chunks that must be present for the
 *    transform to fire.  All must be present - the requirement is that
 *    png_get_valid() & mask == mask, so if mask is 0 there is no requirement.
 *
 * The condition refers to the original image state - if multiple transforms are
 * used together it is possible to cause a transform that wouldn't fire on the
 * original image to fire.
 *//* pre 1.7.0 *//* INFO_IMAGE *//* WRITE *//* SEQUENTIAL_READ *//* READ_PNG and WRITE_PNG were not defined, so: *//* 1.6.1 added support for the configure test harness, which uses 77 to indicate

   since it no longer defines _BSD_RUNE_T_ yet still desires to export
   rune_t in some cases... *//* Why is this file so hard to maintain properly?  In contrast to
   the comment above regarding BSD/386 1.1, on FreeBSD for as long
   as the symbol has existed, _BSD_RUNE_T_ must not stay defined or
   redundant typedefs will occur when stdlib.h is included after this file. *//* Darwin *//* On BSD/386 1.1, at least, machine/ansi.h defines _BSD_WCHAR_T_
   instead of _WCHAR_T_, and _BSD_RUNE_T_ (which, unlike the other
   symbols in the _FOO_T_ family, stays defined even after its
   corresponding type is defined).  If we define wchar_t, then we
   must undef _WCHAR_T_; for BSD/386 1.1 (and perhaps others), if
   we undef _WCHAR_T_, then we must also define rune_t, since 
   headers like runetype.h assume that if machine/ansi.h is included,
   and _BSD_WCHAR_T_ is not defined, then rune_t is available.
   machine/ansi.h says, "Note that _WCHAR_T_ and _RUNE_T_ must be of
   the same type." *//* Cray Unicos/Mk *//* BeOS *//* FreeBSD 5 *//* Define this type if we are doing the whole job,

   GCC 2.00, make sure that __PTRDIFF_TYPE__, __SIZE_TYPE__, and
   __WCHAR_TYPE__ have reasonable values.  This can happen if the
   parts of GCC is compiled by an older compiler, that actually
   include gstddef.h, such as collect2.  *//* On VxWorks, <type/vxTypesBase.h> may have defined macros like
   _TYPE_size_t which will typedef size_t.  fixincludes patched the
   vxTypesBase.h so that this macro is only defined if _GCC_SIZE_T is
   not defined, and so that defining this macro defines _GCC_SIZE_T.
   If we find that the macros are still defined at this point, we must
   invoke them so that the type is defined as expected.  *//* Sequent's header files use _PTRDIFF_T_ in some conflicting way.
   Just ignore it.  *//* defined(__NetBSD__) *//* Undef _FOO_T_ if we are supposed to define foo_t.  *//* On BSD/386 1.1, at least, machine/ansi.h defines _BSD_WCHAR_T_

   There's no way to win with the other order!  Sun lossage.  *//* snaroff@next.com says the NeXT needs this.  *//* Any one of these symbols __need_* means that GNU libc

   The declarations here must match those in localeinfo.h.

   In the thread-specific locale model (see `uselocale' in <locale.h>)
   we cannot use global variables for these as was done in the past.
   Instead, the following accessor functions return the address of
   each variable, which is local to the current thread if multithreaded.

   These point into arrays of 384, so they can be indexed by any `unsigned
   char' value [0,255]; by EOF (-1); or by any `signed char' value
   [-128,-1).  ISO C requires that the ctype functions work for `unsigned
   char' values and for EOF; we also support negative `signed char' values
   for broken old programs.  The case conversion arrays are of `int's
   rather than `unsigned char's because tolower (EOF) must be EOF, which
   doesn't fit into an `unsigned char'.  But today more important is that
   the arrays are also used for multi-byte character sets.  *//* ! _ISbit  *//* Alphanumeric.  *//* Punctuation.  *//* Control character.  *//* Blank (usually SPC and TAB).  *//* Graphical.  *//* Printing.  *//* Whitespace.  *//* Hexadecimal numeric.  *//* Numeric.  *//* Alphabetic.  *//* lowercase.  *//* UPPERCASE.  *//* __BYTE_ORDER == __LITTLE_ENDIAN *//* These are all the characteristics of characters.
   If there get to be more than 16 distinct characteristics,
   many things must be changed that use `unsigned short int's.

   The characteristics are stored always in network byte order (big
   endian).  We define the bit value interpretations here dependent on the
   machine's byte order.  *//*

   This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
   Most functions are declared using the macro:

   __MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
   `NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
   prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
   `float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
   called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

   Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

   __MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
   instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
   both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

   Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
   NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  *//* Prototype declarations for math functions; helper file for <math.h>.

   the comparison macros from ISO C take two floating-point arguments,
   which need not have the same type.  Choosing what underlying function
   to call requires evaluating the formats of the arguments, then
   selecting which is wider.  The macro __MATH_EVAL_FMT2 provides this
   information, however, only the type of the macro expansion is
   relevant (actually evaluating the expression would be incorrect).
   Thus, the type is used as a template parameter for __iseqsig_type,
   which calls the appropriate underlying function.  *//* Return X == Y but raising "invalid" and setting errno if X or Y is

   unordered numbers.  Many FPUs provide special instructions to support
   these operations.  Generic support in GCC for these as builtins went
   in 2.97, but not all cpus added their patterns until 3.1.  Therefore
   we enable the builtins from 3.1 onwards and use a generic implementation
   othwerwise.  *//* When compiling in strict ISO C compatible mode we must not use the

      other hand, overloading provides the means to distinguish between

      the correct parameter (regardless of type qualifiers (i.e.: const
      and volatile)).  *//* Return nonzero value if X is a signaling NaN.  *//* By default all math functions support both errno and exception handling

   nonconforming but it is more useful than leaving it undefined).  *//* Exceptions raised by math functions.  *//* errno set by math functions.  *//* Bitmasks for the math_errhandling macro.  *//* Since __builtin_isinf_sign is broken for float128 before GCC 7.0,
      use the helper function, __isinff128, with older compilers.  This is
      only provided for C mode, because in C++ mode, GCC has no support
      for __builtin_types_compatible_p (and when in C++ mode, this macro is
      not used anyway, because libstdc++ headers undefine it).  *//* Return nonzero value if X is positive or negative infinity.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is a NaN.  We could use `fpclassify' but
   we already have this functions `__isnan' and it is faster.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is neither zero, subnormal, Inf, nor NaN.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is not +-Inf or NaN.  *//* In C++ mode, __MATH_TG cannot be used, because it relies on
     __builtin_types_compatible_p, which is a C-only builtin.
     The check for __cplusplus allows the use of the builtin instead of
     __MATH_TG. This is provided for libstdc++, only to let its configure
     test work. No further use of this definition of signbit is expected
     in C++ mode, since libstdc++ provides its own version of signbit
     in cmath (which undefines signbit). *//* Return nonzero value if sign of X is negative.  *//* The check for __cplusplus allows the use of the builtin, even
	when optimization for size is on.  This is provided for
	libstdc++, only to let its configure test work when it is built
	with -Os.  No further use of this definition of fpclassify is
	expected in C++ mode, since libstdc++ provides its own version
	of fpclassify in cmath (which undefines fpclassify).  *//* Return number of classification appropriate for X.  *//* GCC bug 66462 means we cannot use the math builtins with -fsignaling-nan,
   so disable builtins if this is enabled.  When fixed in a newer GCC,
   the __SUPPORT_SNAN__ check may be skipped for those versions.  *//* All floating-point numbers can be put in one of these categories.  *//* ISO C99 defines some generic macros which work on any data type.  *//* Depending on the type of TG_ARG, call an appropriately suffixed
   version of FUNC with arguments (including parentheses) ARGS.
   Suffixed functions may not exist for long double if it has the same
   format as double, or for other types with the same format as float,
   double or long double.  The behavior is undefined if the argument
   does not have a real floating type.  The definition may use a
   conditional expression, so all suffixed versions of FUNC must
   return the same type (FUNC may include a cast if necessary rather
   than being a single identifier).  *//* This variable is used by `gamma' and `lgamma'.  *//* Declare functions returning a narrower type.  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT128X || (__HAVE_FLOAT128X && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT64X || (__HAVE_FLOAT64X && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT32X || (__HAVE_FLOAT32X && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT128 || (__HAVE_FLOAT128 && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT64 || (__HAVE_FLOAT64 && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT32 || (__HAVE_FLOAT32 && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT16 || (__HAVE_FLOAT16 && !_LIBC).  *//* Include the file of declarations for _FloatN and _FloatNx
   types.  *//* !(__NO_LONG_DOUBLE_MATH && _LIBC) || __LDBL_COMPAT *//* Include the file of declarations again, this time using `long double'
   instead of `double' and appending l to each function name.  *//* Include the file of declarations again, this time using `float'
   instead of `double' and appending f to each function name.  *//* The file <bits/mathcalls.h> contains the prototypes for all the
   actual math functions.  These macros are used for those prototypes,
   so we can easily declare each function as both `name' and `__name',
   and can declare the float versions `namef' and `__namef'.  *//* Rounding direction macros for fromfp functions.  *//* Get the architecture specific values describing the floating-point
   evaluation.  The following symbols will get defined:

    FP_FAST_FMA
    FP_FAST_FMAF
    FP_FAST_FMAL
		If defined it indicates that the `fma' function
		generally executes about as fast as a multiply and an add.
		This macro is defined only iff the `fma' function is
		implemented directly with a hardware multiply-add instructions.
*//* Define macros for the return values of ilogb and llogb, based on
   __FP_LOGB0_IS_MIN and __FP_LOGBNAN_IS_MIN.

    FP_ILOGB0	Expands to a value returned by `ilogb (0.0)'.
    FP_ILOGBNAN	Expands to a value returned by `ilogb (NAN)'.
    FP_LLOGB0	Expands to a value returned by `llogb (0.0)'.
    FP_LLOGBNAN	Expands to a value returned by `llogb (NAN)'.

*//* Define the following typedefs.

    float_t	floating-point type at least as wide as `float' used
		to evaluate `float' expressions
    double_t	floating-point type at least as wide as `double' used
		to evaluate `double' expressions
*//* Get __GLIBC_FLT_EVAL_METHOD.  *//* Signaling NaN macros, if supported.  *//* __USE_ISOC99 *//* This will raise an "invalid" exception outside static initializers,
   but is the best that can be done in ISO C while remaining a
   constant expression.  *//* IEEE Not A Number.  *//* IEEE positive infinity.  *//* This may provoke compiler warnings, and may not be rounded to
   +Infinity in all IEEE 754 rounding modes, but is the best that can
   be done in ISO C while remaining a constant expression.  10,000 is
   greater than the maximum (decimal) exponent for all supported
   floating-point formats and widths.  *//* Value returned on overflow.  With IEEE 754 floating point, this is
   +Infinity, otherwise the largest representable positive value.  *//* Gather machine dependent type support.  *//* Get machine-dependent vector math functions declarations.  *//* Get definitions of __intmax_t and __uintmax_t.  *//*
 *	ISO C99 Standard: 7.12 Mathematics	<math.h>
 *//* Declarations for math functions.

 * The following is *just* the result of a round trip from 8-bit sRGB to linear
 * then back to 8-bit sRGB when it is done by libpng.  There are two problems:
 *
 * 1) libpng currently uses a 2.2 power law with no linear segment, this results
 * in instability in the low values and even with 16-bit precision sRGB(1) ends
 * up mapping to sRGB(0) as a result of rounding in the 16-bit representation.
 * This gives an error of 1 in the handling of value 1 only.
 *
 * 2) libpng currently uses an intermediate 8-bit linear value in gamma
 * correction of 8-bit values.  This results in many more errors, the worse of
 * which is mapping sRGB(14) to sRGB(0).
 *
 * The general 'error_via_linear' is more complex because of pre-multiplication,
 * this compounds the 8-bit errors according to the alpha value of the pixel.
 * As a result 256 values are pre-calculated for error_via_linear.
 *//* Copy the error values into the Transform: *//* Else the output is colormapped and a background color must be
          * provided; if pngstest crashes then that is a bug in this program
          * (though libpng should png_error as well.)
          *//* TODO: sometimes libpng uses the power law conversion here, how
             * to handle this?
             *//* TODO: sometimes libpng uses the power law conversion here, how

       * linear (16-bit) output the sRGB background color is ignored; the
       * composition is always on the background (so BUFFER_INIT8 * 257), except
       * that for the colormap (i.e. linear colormapped output) black is used.
       *//* Rule 1: background only need be supplied if alpha is to be removed *//* default: not required *//* Follow the libpng simplified API rules to work out what to pass to the gpc
    * routines as a background value, if one is not required pass NULL so that
    * this program crashes in the even of a programming error.
    *//* The caller handles the colormap->pixel value conversion, so the
       * transform function just gets a pixel value, however because libpng
       * currently contains a different implementation for mapping a colormap if
       * both input and output are colormapped we need different conversion
       * functions to deal with errors in the libpng implementation.
       *//* The input is not colormapped but the output is, the errors will
       * typically be large (only the grayscale-no-alpha case permits preserving
       * even 8-bit values.)
       *//* Check for an error in this program: *//* Remove the ordering information: *//* The loaders (which need the ordering information) *//* set by caller if required *//* Store the original images for error messages *//* Return a 'transform' as above for the given format conversion. *//* Where these are stored in the static array (for 'accumulate') *//* Three error values for transparent, partially transparent and opaque

       *//* For 'via_linear' transforms the final, from linear, step, else NULL *//* A function to perform the required transform *//* Output is 8-bit (else 16-bit) *//* Accumulate component errors (don't log) *//* Sample values come from the palette *//* Value of input alpha that is opaque *//* Precalculated values: *//* 'background' is the value passed to the gpc_ routines, it may be NULL if

    *//* Output image *//* Input image *//* Basic pixel information: *//* flag checks *//* COLORMAP flag check *//* machine generated *//* extra check also required *//* The error arrays record the error in the same matrix; 64 entries, however
 * the different algorithms used in libpng for colormap and direct conversions
 * mean that four separate matrices are used (for each combination of
 * colormapped and direct.)
 *
 * In some cases the conversion between sRGB formats goes via a linear
 * intermediate; an sRGB to linear conversion (as above) is followed by a simple
 * linear to sRGB step with no other conversions.  This is done by a separate
 * error array from an arbitrary 'in' format to one of the four basic outputs
 * (since final output is always sRGB not colormapped).
 *
 * These arrays may be modified if the --accumulate flag is set during the run;
 * then instead of logging errors they are simply added in.
 *
 * The three entries are currently for transparent, partially transparent and
 * opaque input pixel values.  Notice that alpha should be exact in each case.
 *
 * Errors in alpha should only occur when converting from a direct format
 * to a colormapped format, when alpha is effectively smashed (so large
 * errors can occur.)  There should be no error in the '0' and 'opaque'
 * values.  The fourth entry in the array is used for the alpha error (and it
 * should always be zero for the 'via linear' case since this is never color
 * mapped.)
 *
 * Mapping to a colormap smashes the colors, it is necessary to have separate
 * values for these cases because they are much larger; it is very much
 * impossible to obtain a reasonable result, these are held in
 * gpc_error_to_colormap.

   defines %a as a standalone format specifier that reads a floating-
   point number; moreover, POSIX.1-2008 provides the same feature
   using the modifier letter 'm' instead (%ms, %mS, %m[...]).

   We now follow C99 unless GNU extensions are active and the compiler
   is specifically in C89 or C++98 mode (strict or not).  For
   instance, with GCC, -std=gnu11 will have C99-compliant scanf with

   old extension.  *//* The function 'gets' existed in C89, but is impossible to use
   safely.  It has been removed from ISO C11 and ISO C++14.  Note: for
   compatibility with various implementations of <cstdio>, this test
   must consider only the value of __cplusplus when compiling C++.  *//* Some C libraries once required _REENTRANT and/or _THREAD_SAFE to be
   defined in all multithreaded code.  GNU libc has not required this
   for many years.  We now treat them as compatibility synonyms for
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L, which is the earliest level of POSIX with
   comprehensive support for multithreaded code.  Using them never
   lowers the selected level of POSIX conformance, only raises it.  *//* If none of the ANSI/POSIX macros are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE
   is defined, use POSIX.1-2008 (or another version depending on
   _XOPEN_SOURCE).  *//* This is to enable compatibility for ISO C++11.
   Check the temporary macro for now, too.  *//* This is to enable compatibility for ISO C++17.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C90 Amendment 1:1995 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C99 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C11 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C2X extension.  *//* If nothing (other than _GNU_SOURCE and _DEFAULT_SOURCE) is defined,

   transitioned to use the new macro.  *//* Whether to use feature set F.  *//* Similarly for clang.  Features added to GCC after version 4.2 may
   or may not also be available in clang, and clang's definitions of
   __GNUC(_MINOR)__ are fixed at 4 and 2 respectively.  Not all such
   features can be queried via __has_extension/__has_feature.  *//* Convenience macro to test the version of gcc.
   Use like this:
   #if __GNUC_PREREQ (2,8)
   ... code requiring gcc 2.8 or later ...
   #endif
   Note: only works for GCC 2.0 and later, because __GNUC_MINOR__ was
   added in 2.0.  *//* Suppress kernel-name space pollution unless user expressedly asks
   for it.  *//* Undefine everything, so we get a clean slate.  *//* These are defined by the user (or the compiler)
   to specify the desired environment:

   __STRICT_ANSI__	ISO Standard C.
   _ISOC99_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C89 from ISO C99.
   _ISOC11_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C11.
   _ISOC2X_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C2X.
   __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT2__
			Extensions to ISO C99 from TR 27431-2:2010.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-1:2014.

   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-3:2015.

   _POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
			if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
			if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
			if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
			if >=200809L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2008
   _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
			Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
			sixth revision, to 700 for the seventh revision.
   _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
   _LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
   _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
   _ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE	The default set of features (taking precedence over
			__STRICT_ANSI__).

   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	Add security hardening to many library functions.
			Set to 1 or 2; 2 performs stricter checks than 1.

   _REENTRANT, _THREAD_SAFE
			Obsolete; equivalent to _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200809L, as well as enabling miscellaneous functions from BSD and
   SVID.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.  For
   example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
   give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __GLIBC_USE (F)	Define things from feature set F.  This is defined
			to 1 or 0; the subsequent macros are either defined
			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
			__GLIBC_USE.
   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_ISOCXX11	Define ISO C++11 things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.

   ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
   when an affected header is included, not when the first system
   header is included, and so they are handled in
   <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
   guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
   system header included are handled here.  *//usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/signum-generic.h_NSIG(__SIGRTMAX + 1)__SIGRTMAX__SIGRTMINSIGCLDSIGCHLDSIGIOTSIGABRTSIGIOSIGPOLLSIGWINCHSIGUSR2SIGUSR1SIGPROFSIGVTALRMSIGXFSZSIGXCPUSIGTTOUSIGTTINSIGCONTSIGTSTPSIGSTOPSIGURGSIGALRMSIGPIPESIGSYSSIGBUSSIGKILLSIGTRAPSIGQUITSIGHUPSIGTERMSIGSEGVSIGFPESIGILLSIGINTSIG_HOLD((__sighandler_t) 2)SIG_IGN((__sighandler_t) 1)SIG_DFL((__sighandler_t) 0)SIG_ERR((__sighandler_t) -1)_BITS_SIGNUM_GENERIC_H_SIGNAL_H/* bits/signum-generic.h.  *//* Biggest signal number + 1 (including real-time signals).  *//* Not all systems support real-time signals.  bits/signum.h indicates

   as of 1003.1-2013, no additional signals have been added by POSIX.
   We also define here signal names that historically exist in every
   real-world POSIX variant (e.g. SIGWINCH).

   Signals in the 1-15 range are defined with their historical numbers.
   For other signals, we use the BSD numbers.
   There are two unallocated signal numbers in the 1-31 range: 7 and 29.
   Signal number 0 is reserved for use as kill(pid, 0), to test whether
   a process exists without sending it a signal.  *//* Add signal to hold mask.  *//* Ignore signal.  *//* Default action.  *//* Error return.  *//* Fake signal functions.  *//* Signal number constants.  Generic template.

   This macro has different values in different kernel versions.  The
   latest versions of the kernel use 1024 and this is good choice.  Since
   the C library implementation of readv/writev is able to emulate the
   functionality even if the currently running kernel does not support
   this large value the readv/writev call will not fail because of this.  *//* Implementation limits related to sys/uio.h - Linux version.

 * Section 6: IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * Support for arbitrary implementation-specific optimizations.  The API allows
 * particular options to be turned on or off.  'Option' is the number of the
 * option and 'onoff' is 0 (off) or non-0 (on).  The value returned is given
 * by the PNG_OPTION_ defines below.
 *
 * HARDWARE: normally hardware capabilities, such as the Intel SSE instructions,
 *           are detected at run time, however sometimes it may be impossible
 *           to do this in user mode, in which case it is necessary to discover
 *           the capabilities in an OS specific way.  Such capabilities are
 *           listed here when libpng has support for them and must be turned
 *           ON by the application if present.
 *
 * SOFTWARE: sometimes software optimizations actually result in performance
 *           decrease on some architectures or systems, or with some sets of
 *           PNG images.  'Software' options allow such optimizations to be
 *           selected at run time.

    * run out of buffer space but return a corrected size which should work.

    * appropriately.
    *//* The number of uncompressed bytes in the PNG byte encoding of the image;

    * NOTE: while PNG_IMAGE_SIZE cannot overflow for an image in memory this
    * macro can because of the extra bytes used in the PNG byte encoding.  You
    * need to avoid this macro if your image size approaches 2^30 in width or

 * always be bigger than the original image and it will never be filled.  The
 * following macros are provided to assist in allocating the buffer.
 *//* Return the amount of memory in 'size' required to compress this image.
    * The png_image structure 'image' must be filled in as in the above
    * function and must not be changed before the actual write call, the buffer
    * and all other parameters must also be identical to that in the final
    * write call.  The 'size' variable need not be initialized.
    *
    * NOTE: the macro returns true/false, if false is returned 'size' will be
    * set to zero and the write failed and probably will fail if tried again.
    *//* Write the image to the given memory buffer.  The function both writes the
    * whole PNG data stream to *memory and updates *memory_bytes with the count
    * of bytes written.
    *
    * 'memory' may be NULL.  In this case *memory_bytes is not read however on
    * success the number of bytes which would have been written will still be
    * stored in *memory_bytes.  On failure *memory_bytes will contain 0.
    *
    * If 'memory' is not NULL it must point to memory[*memory_bytes] of
    * writeable memory.
    *
    * If the function returns success memory[*memory_bytes] (if 'memory' is not
    * NULL) contains the written PNG data.  *memory_bytes will always be less
    * than or equal to the original value.
    *
    * If the function returns false and *memory_bytes was not changed an error
    * occurred during write.  If *memory_bytes was changed, or is not 0 if
    * 'memory' was NULL, the write would have succeeded but for the memory
    * buffer being too small.  *memory_bytes contains the required number of
    * bytes and will be bigger that the original value.
    *//* With all write APIs if image is in one of the linear formats with 16-bit
 * data then setting convert_to_8_bit will cause the output to be an 8-bit PNG
 * gamma encoded according to the sRGB specification, otherwise a 16-bit linear
 * encoded PNG file is written.
 *
 * With color-mapped data formats the colormap parameter point to a color-map
 * with at least image->colormap_entries encoded in the specified format.  If
 * the format is linear the written PNG color-map will be converted to sRGB
 * regardless of the convert_to_8_bit flag.
 *
 * With all APIs row_stride is handled as in the read APIs - it is the spacing
 * from one row to the next in component sized units (1 or 2 bytes) and if
 * negative indicates a bottom-up row layout in the buffer.  If row_stride is
 * zero, libpng will calculate it for you from the image width and number of
 * channels.
 *
 * Note that the write API does not support interlacing, sub-8-bit pixels or
 * most ancillary chunks.  If you need to write text chunks (e.g. for copyright
 * notices) you need to use one of the other APIs.
 *//* Write the image to the given (FILE*). *//* Write the image to the named file. *//* WRITE APIS
 * ----------
 * For write you must initialize a png_image structure to describe the image to
 * be written.  To do this use memset to set the whole structure to 0 then
 * initialize fields describing your image.
 *
 * version: must be set to PNG_IMAGE_VERSION
 * opaque: must be initialized to NULL
 * width: image width in pixels
 * height: image height in rows
 * format: the format of the data (image and color-map) you wish to write
 * flags: set to 0 unless one of the defined flags applies; set
 *    PNG_IMAGE_FLAG_COLORSPACE_NOT_sRGB for color format images where the RGB
 *    values do not correspond to the colors in sRGB.
 * colormap_entries: set to the number of entries in the color-map (0 to 256)
 *//* SIMPLIFIED_READ *//* Free any data allocated by libpng in image->opaque, setting the pointer to
    * NULL.  May be called at any time after the structure is initialized.
    *//* Finish reading the image into the supplied buffer and clean up the
    * png_image structure.
    *
    * row_stride is the step, in byte or 2-byte units as appropriate,
    * between adjacent rows.  A positive stride indicates that the top-most row
    * is first in the buffer - the normal top-down arrangement.  A negative
    * stride indicates that the bottom-most row is first in the buffer.
    *
    * background need only be supplied if an alpha channel must be removed from
    * a png_byte format and the removal is to be done by compositing on a solid
    * color; otherwise it may be NULL and any composition will be done directly
    * onto the buffer.  The value is an sRGB color to use for the background,
    * for grayscale output the green channel is used.
    *
    * background must be supplied when an alpha channel must be removed from a
    * single byte color-mapped output format, in other words if:
    *
    * 1) The original format from png_image_begin_read_from_* had
    *    PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_ALPHA set.
    * 2) The format set by the application does not.
    * 3) The format set by the application has PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_COLORMAP set and
    *    PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_LINEAR *not* set.
    *
    * For linear output removing the alpha channel is always done by compositing
    * on black and background is ignored.
    *
    * colormap must be supplied when PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_COLORMAP is set.  It must
    * be at least the size (in bytes) returned by PNG_IMAGE_COLORMAP_SIZE.
    * image->colormap_entries will be updated to the actual number of entries
    * written to the colormap; this may be less than the original value.
    *//* The PNG header is read from the given memory buffer. *//* STDIO *//* The PNG header is read from the stdio FILE object. *//* The named file is opened for read and the image header is filled in
    * from the PNG header in the file.
    *//* READ APIs
 * ---------
 *
 * The png_image passed to the read APIs must have been initialized by setting
 * the png_controlp field 'opaque' to NULL (or, safer, memset the whole thing.)
 *//* This indicates that the image and all its allocated resources have been
       * freed or released and are not available for consumption.
    *//* On read if the image is a 16-bit per component image and there is no gAMA
    * or sRGB chunk assume that the components are sRGB encoded.  Notice that
    * images output by the simplified API always have gamma information; setting
    * this flag only affects the interpretation of 16-bit images from an
    * external source.  It is recommended that the application expose this flag
    * to the user; the user can normally easily recognize the difference between
    * linear and sRGB encoding.  This flag has no effect on write - the data
    * passed to the write APIs must have the correct encoding (as defined
    * above.)
    *
    * If the flag is not set (the default) input 16-bit per component data is
    * assumed to be linear.
    *
    * NOTE: the flag can only be set after the png_image_begin_read_ call,
    * because that call initializes the 'flags' field.
    *//* On write emphasise speed over compression; the resultant PNG file will be
    * larger but will be produced significantly faster, particular for large
    * images.  Do not use this option for images which will be distributed, only
    * used it when producing intermediate files that will be read back in
    * repeatedly.  For a typical 24-bit image the option will double the read
    * speed at the cost of increasing the image size by 25%, however for many
    * more compressible images the PNG file can be 10 times larger with only a
    * slight speed gain.
    *//* This indicates that the RGB values of the in-memory bitmap do not
    * correspond to the red, green and blue end-points defined by sRGB.
    *//* PNG_IMAGE_FLAG_*
 *
 * Flags containing additional information about the image are held in the
 * 'flags' field of png_image.
 *//* Return the size, in bytes, of the color-map of this image.  If the image
    * format is not a color-map format this will return a size sufficient for
    * 256 entries in the given format; check PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_COLORMAP if
    * you don't want to allocate a color-map in this case.
    *//* Return the size, in bytes, of the image in memory given just a png_image;
    * the row stride is the minimum stride required for the image.
    *//* Return the size, in bytes, of an image buffer given a png_image and a row
    * stride - the number of components to leave space for in each row.
    *
    * WARNING: this macro overflows a 32-bit integer for some large PNG images,
    * libpng will refuse to process an image where such an overflow would occur.
    *//* Return the total number of components in a single row of the image; this
    * is the minimum 'row stride', the minimum count of components between each
    * row.  For a color-mapped image this is the minimum number of bytes in a
    * row.
    *
    * WARNING: this macro overflows for some images with more than one component
    * and very large image widths.  libpng will refuse to process an image where
    * this macro would overflow.
    *//* Information about the whole row, or whole image *//* The size, in bytes, of a complete pixel; 1 for a color-mapped image. *//* The size, in bytes, of each component in a pixel; 1 for a color-mapped
    * image.
    *//* The number of separate channels (components) in a pixel; 1 for a
    * color-mapped image.
    *//* Corresponding information about the pixels *//* The maximum size of the color-map required by the format expressed in a
    * count of components.  This can be used to compile-time allocate a
    * color-map:
    *
    * png_uint_16 colormap[PNG_IMAGE_MAXIMUM_COLORMAP_COMPONENTS(linear_fmt)];
    *
    * png_byte colormap[PNG_IMAGE_MAXIMUM_COLORMAP_COMPONENTS(sRGB_fmt)];
    *
    * Alternatively use the PNG_IMAGE_COLORMAP_SIZE macro below to use the
    * information from one of the png_image_begin_read_ APIs and dynamically
    * allocate the required memory.
    *//* This is the size of the sample data for one sample.  If the image is
    * color-mapped it is the size of one color-map entry (and image pixels are
    * one byte in size), otherwise it is the size of one image pixel.
    *//* Return the size in bytes of a single component of a pixel or color-map
    * entry (as appropriate) in the image: 1 or 2.
    *//* Return the total number of channels in a given format: 1..4 *//* PNG_IMAGE macros
 *
 * These are convenience macros to derive information from a png_image
 * structure.  The PNG_IMAGE_SAMPLE_ macros return values appropriate to the
 * actual image sample values - either the entries in the color-map or the
 * pixels in the image.  The PNG_IMAGE_PIXEL_ macros return corresponding values
 * for the pixels and will always return 1 for color-mapped formats.  The
 * remaining macros return information about the rows in the image and the
 * complete image.
 *
 * NOTE: All the macros that take a png_image::format parameter are compile time
 * constants if the format parameter is, itself, a constant.  Therefore these
 * macros can be used in array declarations and case labels where required.
 * Similarly the macros are also pre-processor constants (sizeof is not used) so
 * they can be used in #if tests.
 *
 * First the information about the samples.
 *//* With color-mapped formats the image data is one byte for each pixel, the byte
 * is an index into the color-map which is formatted as above.  To obtain a
 * color-mapped format it is sufficient just to add the PNG_FOMAT_FLAG_COLORMAP
 * to one of the above definitions, or you can use one of the definitions below.
 *//* Then the linear 2-byte formats.  When naming these "Y" is used to
 * indicate a luminance (gray) channel.
 *//* Commonly used formats have predefined macros.
 *
 * First the single byte (sRGB) formats:
 *//* alpha channel is associated *//* alpha channel comes first *//* BGR colors, else order is RGB *//* image data is color-mapped *//* 2-byte channels else 1-byte *//* color format: otherwise grayscale *//* format with an alpha channel *//* PNG_FORMAT_*
 *
 * #defines to be used in png_image::format.  Each #define identifies a
 * particular layout of sample data and, if present, alpha values.  There are
 * separate defines for each of the two component encodings.
 *
 * A format is built up using single bit flag values.  All combinations are
 * valid.  Formats can be built up from the flag values or you can use one of
 * the predefined values below.  When testing formats always use the FORMAT_FLAG
 * macros to test for individual features - future versions of the library may
 * add new flags.
 *
 * When reading or writing color-mapped images the format should be set to the
 * format of the entries in the color-map then png_image_{read,write}_colormap
 * called to read or write the color-map and set the format correctly for the
 * image data.  Do not set the PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_COLORMAP bit directly!
 *
 * NOTE: libpng can be built with particular features disabled. If you see
 * compiler errors because the definition of one of the following flags has been
 * compiled out it is because libpng does not have the required support.  It is
 * possible, however, for the libpng configuration to enable the format on just
 * read or just write; in that case you may see an error at run time.  You can
 * guard against this by checking for the definition of the appropriate
 * "_SUPPORTED" macro, one of:
 *
 *    PNG_SIMPLIFIED_{READ,WRITE}_{BGR,AFIRST}_SUPPORTED
 *//* The samples of the image have one to four channels whose components have
 * original values in the range 0 to 1.0:
 *
 * 1: A single gray or luminance channel (G).
 * 2: A gray/luminance channel and an alpha channel (GA).
 * 3: Three red, green, blue color channels (RGB).
 * 4: Three color channels and an alpha channel (RGBA).
 *
 * The components are encoded in one of two ways:
 *
 * a) As a small integer, value 0..255, contained in a single byte.  For the
 * alpha channel the original value is simply value/255.  For the color or
 * luminance channels the value is encoded according to the sRGB specification
 * and matches the 8-bit format expected by typical display devices.
 *
 * The color/gray channels are not scaled (pre-multiplied) by the alpha
 * channel and are suitable for passing to color management software.
 *
 * b) As a value in the range 0..65535, contained in a 2-byte integer.  All
 * channels can be converted to the original value by dividing by 65535; all
 * channels are linear.  Color channels use the RGB encoding (RGB end-points) of
 * the sRGB specification.  This encoding is identified by the
 * PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_LINEAR flag below.
 *
 * When the simplified API needs to convert between sRGB and linear colorspaces,
 * the actual sRGB transfer curve defined in the sRGB specification (see the
 * article at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB>) is used, not the gamma=1/2.2
 * approximation used elsewhere in libpng.
 *
 * When an alpha channel is present it is expected to denote pixel coverage
 * of the color or luminance channels and is returned as an associated alpha
 * channel: the color/gray channels are scaled (pre-multiplied) by the alpha
 * value.
 *
 * The samples are either contained directly in the image data, between 1 and 8
 * bytes per pixel according to the encoding, or are held in a color-map indexed
 * by bytes in the image data.  In the case of a color-map the color-map entries
 * are individual samples, encoded as above, and the image data has one byte per
 * pixel to select the relevant sample from the color-map.
 *//*
    * The result is a two-bit code such that a value more than 1 indicates
    * a failure in the API just called:
    *
    *    0 - no warning or error
    *    1 - warning
    *    2 - error
    *    3 - error preceded by warning
    *//* In the event of an error or warning the following field will be set to a
    * non-zero value and the 'message' field will contain a '\0' terminated
    * string with the libpng error or warning message.  If both warnings and
    * an error were encountered, only the error is recorded.  If there
    * are multiple warnings, only the first one is recorded.
    *
    * The upper 30 bits of this value are reserved, the low two bits contain
    * a value as follows:
    *//* Number of entries in the color-map *//* A bit mask containing informational flags *//* Image format as defined below *//* Image height in pixels (rows) *//* Image width in pixels (columns) *//* Set to PNG_IMAGE_VERSION *//* Initialize to NULL, free with png_image_free *//*******************************************************************************
 * Section 5: SIMPLIFIED API
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * Please read the documentation in libpng-manual.txt (TODO: write said
 * documentation) if you don't understand what follows.
 *
 * The simplified API hides the details of both libpng and the PNG file format
 * itself.  It allows PNG files to be read into a very limited number of
 * in-memory bitmap formats or to be written from the same formats.  If these
 * formats do not accommodate your needs then you can, and should, use the more
 * sophisticated APIs above - these support a wide variety of in-memory formats
 * and a wide variety of sophisticated transformations to those formats as well
 * as a wide variety of APIs to manipulate ancillary information.
 *
 * To read a PNG file using the simplified API:
 *
 * 1) Declare a 'png_image' structure (see below) on the stack, set the
 *    version field to PNG_IMAGE_VERSION and the 'opaque' pointer to NULL
 *    (this is REQUIRED, your program may crash if you don't do it.)
 * 2) Call the appropriate png_image_begin_read... function.
 * 3) Set the png_image 'format' member to the required sample format.
 * 4) Allocate a buffer for the image and, if required, the color-map.
 * 5) Call png_image_finish_read to read the image and, if required, the
 *    color-map into your buffers.
 *
 * There are no restrictions on the format of the PNG input itself; all valid
 * color types, bit depths, and interlace methods are acceptable, and the
 * input image is transformed as necessary to the requested in-memory format
 * during the png_image_finish_read() step.  The only caveat is that if you
 * request a color-mapped image from a PNG that is full-color or makes
 * complex use of an alpha channel the transformation is extremely lossy and the
 * result may look terrible.
 *
 * To write a PNG file using the simplified API:
 *
 * 1) Declare a 'png_image' structure on the stack and memset() it to all zero.
 * 2) Initialize the members of the structure that describe the image, setting
 *    the 'format' member to the format of the image samples.
 * 3) Call the appropriate png_image_write... function with a pointer to the
 *    image and, if necessary, the color-map to write the PNG data.
 *
 * png_image is a structure that describes the in-memory format of an image
 * when it is being read or defines the in-memory format of an image that you
 * need to write:
 *//* CHECK_FOR_INVALID_INDEX *//* No macros; revert to the (redefined) function *//* If PNG_PREFIX is defined the same thing as below happens in pnglibconf.h,
 * but defining a macro name prefixed with PNG_PREFIX.
 *//* From libpng-1.4.0 until 1.4.4, the png_get_uint_16 macro (but not the
    * function) incorrectly returned a value of type png_uint_32.
    *//* Inline macros to do direct reads of bytes from the input buffer.
 * The png_get_int_32() routine assumes we are using two's complement
 * format for negative values, which is almost certainly true.
 *//* No png_save_int_16 -- may be added if there's a real need for it. *//* Place a 16-bit number into a buffer in PNG byte order.
 * The parameter is declared unsigned int, not png_uint_16,
 * just to avoid potential problems on pre-ANSI C compilers.
 *//* Place a 32-bit number into a buffer in PNG byte order (big-endian). *//* No png_get_int_16 -- may be added if there's a real need for it. *//* READ_COMPOSITE_NODIV *//* Standard method using integer division *//* fg and bg should be in `gamma 1.0' space; alpha is the opacity *//* With these routines we avoid an integer divide, which will be slower on
 * most machines.  However, it does take more operations than the corresponding
 * divide method, so it may be slower on a few RISC systems.  There are two
 * shifts (by 8 or 16 bits) and an addition, versus a single integer divide.
 *
 * Note that the rounding factors are NOT supposed to be the same!  128 and
 * 32768 are correct for the NODIV code; 127 and 32767 are correct for the
 * standard method.
 *
 * [Optimized code by Greg Roelofs and Mark Adler...blame us for bugs. :-) ]
 *//* Two macros which return a boolean (0 or 1) saying whether the given row
 * or column is in a particular pass.  These use a common utility macro that
 * returns a mask for a given pass - the offset 'off' selects the row or
 * column version.  The mask has the appropriate bit set for each column in
 * the tile.
 *//* For the reader row callbacks (both progressive and sequential) it is
 * necessary to find the row in the output image given a row in an interlaced
 * image, so two more macros:
 *//* Hence two macros to determine the number of rows or columns in a given
 * pass of an image given its height or width.  In fact these macros may
 * return non-zero even though the sub-image is empty, because the other
 * dimension may be empty for a small image.
 *//* Two macros to help evaluate the number of rows or columns in each
 * pass.  This is expressed as a shift - effectively log2 of the number or
 * rows or columns in each 8x8 tile of the original image.
 *//* A macro to return the offset between pixels in the output row for a pair of
 * pixels in the input - effectively the inverse of the 'COL_SHIFT' macro that
 * follows.  Note that ROW_OFFSET is the offset from one row to the next whereas
 * COL_OFFSET is from one column to the next, within a row.
 *//* Two macros to return the first row and first column of the original,
 * full, image which appears in a given pass.  'pass' is in the range 0
 * to 6 and the result is in the range 0 to 7.
 *//* Interlace support.  The following macros are always defined so that if
 * libpng interlace handling is turned off the macros may be used to handle
 * interlaced images within the application.
 *//* IO_STATE *//* current location: sig/hdr/data/crc *//* current operation: reading/writing *//* currently at the chunk crc *//* currently at the chunk data *//* currently at the chunk header *//* currently at the file signature *//* currently writing *//* currently reading *//* no I/O at this moment *//* The flags returned by png_get_io_state() are the following: *//* Removed from libpng 1.6; use png_get_io_chunk_type. *//* Added in libpng-1.4.0 *//* INCH_CONVERSIONS *//* pHYs *//* otherwise not implemented. *//* Added in libpng-1.4.1 *//* Added in libpng-1.2.6 *//* Strip the prepended error numbers ("#nnn ") from error and warning
 * messages before passing them to the error or warning handler.
 *//* For use in png_set_keep_unknown, added to version 1.2.6 *//* The "params" pointer is currently not used and is for future expansion. *//* Png_free_data() will turn off the "valid" flag for anything it frees.
 * If you need to turn it off for a chunk that your application has freed,
 * you can use png_set_invalid(png_ptr, info_ptr, PNG_INFO_CHNK);
 *//* NOTE: prior to 1.6.0 this routine set the 'location' field of the added
    * unknowns to the location currently stored in the png_struct.  This is
    * invariably the wrong value on write.  To fix this call the following API
    * for each chunk in the list with the correct location.  If you know your
    * code won't be compiled on earlier versions you can rely on
    * png_set_unknown_chunks(write-ptr, png_get_unknown_chunks(read-ptr)) doing
    * the correct thing.
    *//* SET_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS *//* The "keep" PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_ parameter for the specified chunk is returned;
 * the result is therefore true (non-zero) if special handling is required,
 * false for the default handling.
 *//* HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN *//* Provide the default handling for all unknown chunks or, optionally, for
 * specific unknown chunks.
 *
 * NOTE: prior to 1.6.0 the handling specified for particular chunks on read was
 * ignored and the default was used, the per-chunk setting only had an effect on
 * write.  If you wish to have chunk-specific handling on read in code that must
 * work on earlier versions you must use a user chunk callback to specify the
 * desired handling (keep or discard.)
 *
 * The 'keep' parameter is a PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_ value as listed below.  The
 * parameter is interpreted as follows:
 *
 * READ:
 *    PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_AS_DEFAULT:
 *       Known chunks: do normal libpng processing, do not keep the chunk (but
 *          see the comments below about PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED)
 *       Unknown chunks: for a specific chunk use the global default, when used
 *          as the default discard the chunk data.
 *    PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_NEVER:
 *       Discard the chunk data.
 *    PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_IF_SAFE:
 *       Keep the chunk data if the chunk is not critical else raise a chunk
 *       error.
 *    PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_ALWAYS:
 *       Keep the chunk data.
 *
 * If the chunk data is saved it can be retrieved using png_get_unknown_chunks,
 * below.  Notice that specifying "AS_DEFAULT" as a global default is equivalent
 * to specifying "NEVER", however when "AS_DEFAULT" is used for specific chunks
 * it simply resets the behavior to the libpng default.
 *
 * INTERACTION WITH USER CHUNK CALLBACKS:
 * The per-chunk handling is always used when there is a png_user_chunk_ptr
 * callback and the callback returns 0; the chunk is then always stored *unless*
 * it is critical and the per-chunk setting is other than ALWAYS.  Notice that
 * the global default is *not* used in this case.  (In effect the per-chunk
 * value is incremented to at least IF_SAFE.)
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: this behavior will change in libpng 1.7 - the global and
 * per-chunk defaults will be honored.  If you want to preserve the current
 * behavior when your callback returns 0 you must set PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_IF_SAFE
 * as the default - if you don't do this libpng 1.6 will issue a warning.
 *
 * If you want unhandled unknown chunks to be discarded in libpng 1.6 and
 * earlier simply return '1' (handled).
 *
 * PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED:
 *    If this is *not* set known chunks will always be handled by libpng and
 *    will never be stored in the unknown chunk list.  Known chunks listed to
 *    png_set_keep_unknown_chunks will have no effect.  If it is set then known
 *    chunks listed with a keep other than AS_DEFAULT will *never* be processed
 *    by libpng, in addition critical chunks must either be processed by the
 *    callback or saved.
 *
 *    The IHDR and IEND chunks must not be listed.  Because this turns off the
 *    default handling for chunks that would otherwise be recognized the
 *    behavior of libpng transformations may well become incorrect!
 *
 * WRITE:
 *    When writing chunks the options only apply to the chunks specified by
 *    png_set_unknown_chunks (below), libpng will *always* write known chunks
 *    required by png_set_ calls and will always write the core critical chunks
 *    (as required for PLTE).
 *
 *    Each chunk in the png_set_unknown_chunks list is looked up in the
 *    png_set_keep_unknown_chunks list to find the keep setting, this is then
 *    interpreted as follows:
 *
 *    PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_AS_DEFAULT:
 *       Write safe-to-copy chunks and write other chunks if the global
 *       default is set to _ALWAYS, otherwise don't write this chunk.
 *    PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_NEVER:
 *       Do not write the chunk.
 *    PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_IF_SAFE:
 *       Write the chunk if it is safe-to-copy, otherwise do not write it.
 *    PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_ALWAYS:
 *       Write the chunk.
 *
 * Note that the default behavior is effectively the opposite of the read case -
 * in read unknown chunks are not stored by default, in write they are written
 * by default.  Also the behavior of PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_IF_SAFE is very different
 * - on write the safe-to-copy bit is checked, on read the critical bit is
 * checked and on read if the chunk is critical an error will be raised.
 *
 * num_chunks:
 * ===========
 *    If num_chunks is positive, then the "keep" parameter specifies the manner
 *    for handling only those chunks appearing in the chunk_list array,
 *    otherwise the chunk list array is ignored.
 *
 *    If num_chunks is 0 the "keep" parameter specifies the default behavior for
 *    unknown chunks, as described above.
 *
 *    If num_chunks is negative, then the "keep" parameter specifies the manner
 *    for handling all unknown chunks plus all chunks recognized by libpng
 *    except for the IHDR, PLTE, tRNS, IDAT, and IEND chunks (which continue to
 *    be processed by libpng.

 * is highly recommended that png_get_sCAL_s be used instead.
 *//* Note while png_set_text() will accept a structure whose text,
 * language, and  translated keywords are NULL pointers, the structure
 * returned by png_get_text will always contain regular
 * zero-terminated C strings.  They might be empty strings but

 * Similarly, the png_get_<chunk> calls are used to read values from the
 * png_info_struct, either storing the parameters in the passed variables, or
 * setting pointers into the png_info_struct where the data is stored.  The
 * png_get_<chunk> functions return a non-zero value if the data was available
 * in info_ptr, or return zero and do not change any of the parameters if the
 * data was not available.

 * These functions should be used instead of directly accessing png_info

 * It is unlikely that this function works correctly as of 1.6.0 and using it
 * may result either in memory leaks or double free of allocated data.
 *//* Free data that was allocated internally *//* Frees a pointer allocated by png_malloc() *//* Added at libpng version 1.2.4 *//* Added at libpng version 1.4.0 *//* PROGRESSIVE_READ *//* Function that combines rows.  'new_row' is a flag that should come from
 * the callback and be non-NULL if anything needs to be done; the library
 * stores its own version of the new data internally and ignores the passed
 * in value.
 *//* A function which may be called *only* outside (after) a call to
 * png_process_data.  It returns the number of bytes of data to skip in the
 * input.  Normally it will return 0, but if it returns a non-zero value the
 * application must skip than number of bytes of input data and pass the
 * following data to the next call to png_process_data.
 *//* A function which may be called *only* within png_process_data to stop the
 * processing of any more data.  The function returns the number of bytes
 * remaining, excluding any that libpng has cached internally.  A subsequent
 * call to png_process_data must supply these bytes again.  If the argument
 * 'save' is set to true the routine will first save all the pending data and
 * will always return 0.
 *//* Function to be called when data becomes available *//* Returns the user pointer associated with the push read functions *//* Sets the function callbacks for the push reader, and a pointer to a
 * user-defined structure available to the callback functions.
 *//* This callback is called only for *unknown* chunks.  If
 * PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED is set then it is possible to set known
 * chunks to be treated as unknown, however in this case the callback must do
 * any processing required by the chunk (e.g. by calling the appropriate
 * png_set_ APIs.)
 *
 * There is no write support - on write, by default, all the chunks in the
 * 'unknown' list are written in the specified position.
 *
 * The integer return from the callback function is interpreted thus:
 *
 * negative: An error occurred; png_chunk_error will be called.
 *     zero: The chunk was not handled, the chunk will be saved. A critical
 *           chunk will cause an error at this point unless it is to be saved.
 * positive: The chunk was handled, libpng will ignore/discard it.
 *
 * See "INTERACTION WITH USER CHUNK CALLBACKS" below for important notes about
 * how this behavior will change in libpng 1.7
 *//* Return information about the row currently being processed.  Note that these
 * APIs do not fail but will return unexpected results if called outside a user

 * row number is the row number within the sub-image of the interlace pass, so
 * the value will increase to the height of the sub-image (not the full image)
 * then reset to 0 for the next pass.
 *
 * Use PNG_ROW_FROM_PASS_ROW(row, pass) and PNG_COL_FROM_PASS_COL(col, pass) to
 * find the output pixel (x,y) given an interlaced sub-image pixel
 * (row,col,pass).  (See below for these macros.)
 *//* Return the user pointer associated with the user transform functions *//* Return the user pointer associated with the memory functions *//* Replace the default memory allocation functions with user supplied one(s). *//* Return the user pointer associated with the I/O functions *//* Replace the default data input function with a user supplied one. *//* Replace the default data output functions with a user supplied one(s).
 * If buffered output is not used, then output_flush_fn can be set to NULL.
 * If PNG_WRITE_FLUSH_SUPPORTED is not defined at libpng compile time
 * output_flush_fn will be ignored (and thus can be NULL).
 * It is probably a mistake to use NULL for output_flush_fn if
 * write_data_fn is not also NULL unless you have built libpng with
 * PNG_WRITE_FLUSH_SUPPORTED undefined, because in this case libpng's
 * default flush function, which uses the standard *FILE structure, will
 * be used.
 *//* Return the user pointer associated with the error functions *//* Replace the (error and abort), and warning functions with user
 * supplied functions.  If no messages are to be printed you must still
 * write and use replacement functions. The replacement error_fn should
 * still do a longjmp to the last setjmp location if you are using this
 * method of error handling.  If error_fn or warning_fn is NULL, the
 * default function will be used.
 *//* Initialize the input/output for the PNG file to the default functions. *//* These next functions are called for input/output, memory, and error
 * handling.  They are in the file pngrio.c, pngwio.c, and pngerror.c,

 * at run time for those applications that need to handle I/O in a
 * different manner by calling png_set_???_fn().  See libpng-manual.txt for

 *//* WRITE_CUSTOMIZE_ZTXT_COMPRESSION *//* If PNG_WRITE_OPTIMIZE_CMF_SUPPORTED is defined, libpng will use a
 * smaller value of window_bits if it can do so safely.
 *//* Also set zlib parameters for compressing non-IDAT chunks *//* WRITE_CUSTOMIZE_COMPRESSION *//* Set the library compression level.  Currently, valid values range from
 * 0 - 9, corresponding directly to the zlib compression levels 0 - 9
 * (0 - no compression, 9 - "maximal" compression).  Note that tests have
 * shown that zlib compression levels 3-6 usually perform as well as level 9
 * for PNG images, and do considerably fewer caclulations.  In the future,
 * these values may not correspond directly to the zlib compression levels.

 *//* Flags for png_set_filter() to say which filters to use.  The flags

 * These values should NOT be changed.
 *//* Set the filtering method(s) used by libpng.  Currently, the only valid
 * value for "method" is 0.
 *//* These functions give the user control over the scan-line filtering in

 * NOTE: this API simply sets the screen and file gamma values. It will

 * file for best results!
 *
 * These routines accept the same gamma values as png_set_alpha_mode (described
 * above).  The PNG_GAMMA_ defines and PNG_DEFAULT_sRGB can be passed to either
 * API (floating point or fixed.)  Notice, however, that the 'file_gamma' value
 * is the inverse of a 'screen gamma' value.
 *//* The threshold on gamma processing is configurable but hard-wired into the
 * library.  The following is the floating point variant.
 *//* Turn on quantizing, and reduce the palette to the number of colors

 *//* Strip the second byte of information from a 16-bit depth file. *//* Name prior to 1.5.4 *//* Scale a 16-bit depth file down to 8-bit, accurately. *//* Handle alpha and tRNS by replacing with a background color.  Prior to
 * libpng-1.5.4 this API must not be called before the PNG file header has been
 * read.  Doing so will result in unexpected behavior and possible warnings or
 * errors if the PNG file contains a bKGD chunk.
 *//* Invert monochrome files *//* Have the code handle the interlacing.  Returns the number of passes.
 * MUST be called before png_read_update_info or png_start_read_image,
 * otherwise it will not have the desired effect.  Note that it is still
 * necessary to call png_read_row or png_read_rows png_get_image_height
 * times for each pass.
*//* Converts files to legal bit depths. *//* Swap packing order of pixels in bytes. *//* Use 1 byte per pixel in 1, 2, or 4-bit depth files. *//* Swap bytes in 16-bit depth files. *//* READ_FILLER || WRITE_FILLER *//* Add an alpha byte to 8-bit or 16-bit Gray or 24-bit or 48-bit RGB images. *//* The values of the PNG_FILLER_ defines should NOT be changed *//* Add a filler byte to 8-bit or 16-bit Gray or 24-bit or 48-bit RGB images. *//* The following are examples of calls to png_set_alpha_mode to achieve the
 * required overall gamma correction and, where necessary, alpha
 * premultiplication.
 *
 * png_set_alpha_mode(pp, PNG_ALPHA_PNG, PNG_DEFAULT_sRGB);
 *    This is the default libpng handling of the alpha channel - it is not
 *    pre-multiplied into the color components.  In addition the call states
 *    that the output is for a sRGB system and causes all PNG files without gAMA
 *    chunks to be assumed to be encoded using sRGB.
 *
 * png_set_alpha_mode(pp, PNG_ALPHA_PNG, PNG_GAMMA_MAC);
 *    In this case the output is assumed to be something like an sRGB conformant
 *    display preceded by a power-law lookup table of power 1.45.  This is how
 *    early Mac systems behaved.
 *
 * png_set_alpha_mode(pp, PNG_ALPHA_STANDARD, PNG_GAMMA_LINEAR);
 *    This is the classic Jim Blinn approach and will work in academic
 *    environments where everything is done by the book.  It has the shortcoming
 *    of assuming that input PNG data with no gamma information is linear - this
 *    is unlikely to be correct unless the PNG files where generated locally.
 *    Most of the time the output precision will be so low as to show
 *    significant banding in dark areas of the image.
 *
 * png_set_expand_16(pp);
 * png_set_alpha_mode(pp, PNG_ALPHA_STANDARD, PNG_DEFAULT_sRGB);
 *    This is a somewhat more realistic Jim Blinn inspired approach.  PNG files
 *    are assumed to have the sRGB encoding if not marked with a gamma value and
 *    the output is always 16 bits per component.  This permits accurate scaling
 *    and processing of the data.  If you know that your input PNG files were
 *    generated locally you might need to replace PNG_DEFAULT_sRGB with the
 *    correct value for your system.
 *
 * png_set_alpha_mode(pp, PNG_ALPHA_OPTIMIZED, PNG_DEFAULT_sRGB);
 *    If you just need to composite the PNG image onto an existing background
 *    and if you control the code that does this you can use the optimization
 *    setting.  In this case you just copy completely opaque pixels to the
 *    output.  For pixels that are not completely transparent (you just skip
 *    those) you do the composition math using png_composite or png_composite_16
 *    below then encode the resultant 8-bit or 16-bit values to match the output
 *    encoding.
 *
 * Other cases
 *    If neither the PNG nor the standard linear encoding work for you because
 *    of the software or hardware you use then you have a big problem.  The PNG
 *    case will probably result in halos around the image.  The linear encoding
 *    will probably result in a washed out, too bright, image (it's actually too
 *    contrasty.)  Try the ALPHA_OPTIMIZED mode above - this will probably
 *    substantially reduce the halos.  Alternatively try:
 *
 * png_set_alpha_mode(pp, PNG_ALPHA_BROKEN, PNG_DEFAULT_sRGB);
 *    This option will also reduce the halos, but there will be slight dark
 *    halos round the opaque parts of the image where the background is light.
 *    In the OPTIMIZED mode the halos will be light halos where the background
 *    is dark.  Take your pick - the halos are unavoidable unless you can get
 *    your hardware/software fixed!  (The OPTIMIZED approach is slightly
 *    faster.)
 *
 * When the default gamma of PNG files doesn't match the output gamma.
 *    If you have PNG files with no gamma information png_set_alpha_mode allows
 *    you to provide a default gamma, but it also sets the output gamma to the
 *    matching value.  If you know your PNG files have a gamma that doesn't
 *    match the output you can take advantage of the fact that
 *    png_set_alpha_mode always sets the output gamma but only sets the PNG
 *    default if it is not already set:
 *
 * png_set_alpha_mode(pp, PNG_ALPHA_PNG, PNG_DEFAULT_sRGB);
 * png_set_alpha_mode(pp, PNG_ALPHA_PNG, PNG_GAMMA_MAC);
 *    The first call sets both the default and the output gamma values, the
 *    second call overrides the output gamma without changing the default.  This
 *    is easier than achieving the same effect with png_set_gamma.  You must use
 *    PNG_ALPHA_PNG for the first call - internal checking in png_set_alpha will
 *    fire if more than one call to png_set_alpha_mode and png_set_background is
 *    made in the same read operation, however multiple calls with PNG_ALPHA_PNG
 *    are ignored.
 *//* Linear *//* Television standards--matches sRGB gamma *//* Old Mac '1.8' gamma and color space *//* sRGB gamma and color space *//* The output_gamma value is a screen gamma in libpng terminology: it expresses
 * how to decode the output values, not how they are encoded.
 *//* the alpha channel is gamma encoded *//* 'PNG' for opaque pixels, else 'STANDARD' *//* as above *//* as above; this is the normal practice *//* according to Porter/Duff *//* according to the PNG standard *//* How the alpha channel is interpreted - this affects how the color channels
 * of a PNG file are returned to the calling application when an alpha channel,
 * or a tRNS chunk in a palette file, is present.
 *
 * This has no effect on the way pixels are written into a PNG output
 * datastream. The color samples in a PNG datastream are never premultiplied
 * with the alpha samples.
 *
 * The default is to return data according to the PNG specification: the alpha
 * channel is a linear measure of the contribution of the pixel to the
 * corresponding composited pixel, and the color channels are unassociated
 * (not premultiplied).  The gamma encoded color channels must be scaled
 * according to the contribution and to do this it is necessary to undo
 * the encoding, scale the color values, perform the composition and re-encode
 * the values.  This is the 'PNG' mode.
 *
 * The alternative is to 'associate' the alpha with the color information by
 * storing color channel values that have been scaled by the alpha.
 * image.  These are the 'STANDARD', 'ASSOCIATED' or 'PREMULTIPLIED' modes
 * (the latter being the two common names for associated alpha color channels).
 *
 * For the 'OPTIMIZED' mode, a pixel is treated as opaque only if the alpha
 * value is equal to the maximum value.
 *
 * The final choice is to gamma encode the alpha channel as well.  This is
 * broken because, in practice, no implementation that uses this choice
 * correctly undoes the encoding before handling alpha composition.  Use this
 * choice only if other serious errors in the software or hardware you use
 * mandate it; the typical serious error is for dark halos to appear around
 * opaque areas of the composited PNG image because of arithmetic overflow.
 *
 * The API function png_set_alpha_mode specifies which of these choices to use
 * with an enumerated 'mode' value and the gamma of the required output:
 *//*for red/green coefficients*//* Reduce RGB to grayscale. *//* Expand the grayscale to 24-bit RGB if necessary. *//* Use blue, green, red order for pixels. *//* Expand to 16-bit channels, forces conversion of palette to RGB and expansion
 * of a tRNS chunk if present.
 *//* Expand data to 24-bit RGB, or 8-bit grayscale, with alpha if available. *//* CONVERT_tIME *//* Convert from time_t to png_time.  Uses gmtime() *//* Convert from a struct tm to png_time *//* To do: remove this from libpng17 (and from libpng17/png.c and pngstruct.h) *//* Convert to a US string format: there is no localization support in this
    * routine.  The original implementation used a 29 character buffer in
    * png_struct, this will be removed in future versions.
    *//* Read the information before the actual image data. *//* Writes all the PNG information before the image. *//* DEPRECATED: this function allowed init structures to be created using the
 * default allocation method (typically malloc).  Use is deprecated in 1.6.0 and

 *//* Allocate and initialize png_ptr struct for writing, and any other memory *//* Allocate and initialize png_ptr struct for reading, and any other memory. *//* Simple signature checking function.  This is the same as calling

 *//* Maximum positive integer used in PNG is (2^31)-1 *//* Flag values for the unknown chunk location byte. *//* mode of operation at read time *//* On write 'location' must be set using the flag values listed below.
    * Notice that on read it is set by libpng however the values stored have
    * more bits set than are listed below.  Always treat the value as a
    * bitmask.  On write set only one bit - setting multiple bits may cause the
    * chunk to be written in multiple places.
    *//* Data, should not be modified on read! *//* Textual chunk name with '\0' terminator *//* png_unknown_chunk is a structure to hold queued chunks for which there is
 * no specific support.  The idea is that we can use this to queue
 * up private chunks for output even though the library doesn't actually
 * know about their semantics.
 *
 * The data in the structure is set by libpng on read and used on write.
 *//* second of minute, 0 - 60 (for leap seconds) *//* minute of hour, 0 - 59 *//* hour of day, 0 - 23 *//* day of month, 1 - 31 *//* month of year, 1 - 12 *//* full year, as in, 1995 *//* png_time is a way to hold the time in an machine independent way.
 * Two conversions are provided, both from time_t and struct tm.  There
 * is no portable way to convert to either of these structures, as far
 * as I know.  If you know of a portable way, send it to me.  As a side
 * note - PNG has always been Year 2000 compliant!
 *//* Supported compression types for text in PNG files (tEXt, and zTXt).

                              1: iTXt, none
                              2: iTXt, deflate  *//* png_text holds the contents of a text/ztxt/itxt chunk in a PNG file,
 * and whether that contents is compressed or not.  The "key" field
 * points to a regular zero-terminated C string.  The "text" fields can be a
 * regular C string, an empty string, or a NULL pointer.
 * However, the structure returned by png_get_text() will always contain
 * the "text" field as a regular zero-terminated C string (possibly
 * empty), never a NULL pointer, so it can be safely used in printf() and
 * other string-handling functions.  Note that the "itxt_length", "lang", and
 * "lang_key" members of the structure only exist when the library is built
 * with iTXt chunk support.  Prior to libpng-1.4.0 the library was built by
 * default without iTXt support. Also note that when iTXt *is* supported,
 * the "lang" and "lang_key" fields contain NULL pointers when the
 * "compression" field contains * PNG_TEXT_COMPRESSION_NONE or
 * PNG_TEXT_COMPRESSION_zTXt. Note that the "compression value" is not the
 * same as what appears in the PNG tEXt/zTXt/iTXt chunk's "compression flag"
 * which is always 0 or 1, or its "compression method" which is always 0.
 *//* number of palette entries *//* palette entries *//* depth of palette samples *//* palette name *//*  When the depth of the sPLT palette is 8 bits, the color and alpha samples
 *  occupy the LSB of their respective members, and the MSB of each member
 *  is zero-filled.  The frequency member always occupies the full 16 bits.
 *//*
 * The following two structures are used for the in-core representation
 * of sPLT chunks.
 *//* for alpha channel files *//* for use in grayscale files *//* for use in red green blue files *//* used for palette files *//* Three color definitions.  The order of the red, green, and blue, (and the
 * exact size) is not important, although the size of the fields need to
 * be png_byte or png_uint_16 (as defined below).
 *//* Types with names ending 'p' are pointer types.  The corresponding types with
 * names ending 'rp' are identical pointer types except that the pointer is
 * marked 'restrict', which means that it is the only pointer to the object
 * passed to the function.  Applications should not use the 'restrict' types;
 * it is always valid to pass 'p' to a pointer with a function argument of the
 * corresponding 'rp' type.  Different compilers have different rules with
 * regard to type matching in the presence of 'restrict'.  For backward
 * compatibility libpng callbacks never have 'restrict' in their parameters and,
 * consequentially, writing portable application code is extremely difficult if
 * an attempt is made to use 'restrict'.
 *//* png_info contains information read from or to be written to a PNG file.  One
 * or more of these must exist while reading or creating a PNG file.  The
 * information is not used by libpng during read but is used to control what
 * gets written when a PNG file is created.  "png_get_" function calls read
 * information during read and "png_set_" functions calls write information
 * when creating a PNG.
 * been moved into a separate header file that is not accessible to
 * applications.  Read libpng-manual.txt or libpng.3 for more info.
 *//* Basic control structions.  Read libpng-manual.txt or libpng.3 for more info.
 *
 * png_struct is the cache of information used while reading or writing a single
 * PNG file.  One of these is always required, although the simplified API
 * (below) hides the creation and destruction of it.
 *//* This triggers a compiler error in png.c, if png.c and png.h
 * do not agree upon the version number.
 *//* Section 3: type definitions, including structures and compile time
 * constants.
 * See pngconf.h for base types that vary by machine/system
 *//* Section 2: run time configuration
 * See pnglibconf.h for build time configuration
 *
 * Run time configuration allows the application to choose between
 * implementations of certain arithmetic APIs.  The default is set
 * at build time and recorded in pnglibconf.h, but it is safe to
 * override these (and only these) settings.  Note that this won't
 * change what the library does, only application code, and the
 * settings can (and probably should) be made on a per-file basis
 * by setting the #defines before including png.h
 *
 * Use macros to read integers from PNG data or use the exported
 * functions?
 *   PNG_USE_READ_MACROS: use the macros (see below)  Note that
 *     the macros evaluate their argument multiple times.
 *   PNG_NO_USE_READ_MACROS: call the relevant library function.
 *
 * Use the alternative algorithm for compositing alpha samples that
 * does not use division?
 *   PNG_READ_COMPOSITE_NODIV_SUPPORTED: use the 'no division'
 *      algorithm.
 *   PNG_NO_READ_COMPOSITE_NODIV: use the 'division' algorithm.
 *
 * How to handle benign errors if PNG_ALLOW_BENIGN_ERRORS is
 * false?
 *   PNG_ALLOW_BENIGN_ERRORS: map calls to the benign error
 *      APIs to png_warning.
 * Otherwise the calls are mapped to png_error.
 *//* Section 1: [omitted] *//* This file is arranged in several sections:
 *
 * 1. [omitted]
 * 2. Any configuration options that can be specified by for the application
 *    code when it is built.  (Build time configuration is in pnglibconf.h)
 * 3. Type definitions (base types are defined in pngconf.h), structure
 *    definitions.
 * 4. Exported library functions.
 * 5. Simplified API.
 * 6. Implementation options.
 *
 * The library source code has additional files (principally pngpriv.h) that

 * If you just need to read a PNG file and don't want to read the documentation
 * skip to the end of this file and read the section entitled 'simplified API'.
 *//* Note about libpng version numbers:
 *
 *    Due to various miscommunications, unforeseen code incompatibilities
 *    and occasional factors outside the authors' control, version numbering
 *    on the library has not always been consistent and straightforward.
 *    The following table summarizes matters since version 0.89c, which was
 *    the first widely used release:

 *
 *    Henceforth the source version will match the shared-library major and
 *    minor numbers; the shared-library major version number will be used for
 *    changes in backward compatibility, as it is intended.
 *    The PNG_LIBPNG_VER macro, which is not used within libpng but is
 *    available for applications, is an unsigned integer of the form XYYZZ
 *    corresponding to the source version X.Y.Z (leading zeros in Y and Z).
 *    Beta versions were given the previous public release number plus a
 *    letter, until version 1.0.6j; from then on they were given the upcoming
 *    public release number plus "betaNN" or "rcNN".
 *
 *    Binary incompatibility exists only when applications make direct access
 *    to the info_ptr or png_ptr members through png.h, and the compiled
 *    application is loaded with a different version of the library.
 *
 *    DLLNUM will change each time there are forward or backward changes
 *    in binary compatibility (e.g., when a new feature is added).
 *
 * See libpng.txt or libpng.3 for more information.  The PNG specification
 * is available as a W3C Recommendation and as an ISO/IEC Standard; see
 * <https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-PNG-20031110/>

   to FROMFD and TOFD respectively.  *//* Make a link to FROM named TO.  *//* Return 1 if FD is a valid descriptor associated
   with a terminal, zero if not.  *//* Store at most BUFLEN characters of the pathname of the terminal FD is
   open on in BUF.  Return 0 on success, otherwise an error number.  *//* Return the pathname of the terminal FD is open on, or NULL on errors.
   The returned storage is good only until the next call to this function.  *//* Use misc or XPG < 7. *//* Clone the calling process, but without copying the whole address space.
   The calling process is suspended until the new process exits or is
   replaced by a call to `execve'.  Return -1 for errors, 0 to the new process,
   and the process ID of the new process to the old process.  *//* Clone the calling process, creating an exact copy.
   Return -1 for errors, 0 to the new process,
   and the process ID of the new process to the old process.  *//* Set the real group ID, effective group ID, and saved-set group ID,
   of the calling process to RGID, EGID, and SGID, respectively.  *//* Set the real user ID, effective user ID, and saved-set user ID,
   of the calling process to RUID, EUID, and SUID, respectively.  *//* Fetch the real group ID, effective group ID, and saved-set group ID,
   of the calling process.  *//* Fetch the real user ID, effective user ID, and saved-set user ID,
   of the calling process.  *//* Set the effective group ID of the calling process to GID.  *//* Set the real group ID of the calling process to RGID,
   and the effective group ID of the calling process to EGID.  *//* Set the group ID of the calling process to GID.
   If the calling process is the super-user, set the real
   and effective group IDs, and the saved set-group-ID to GID;
   if not, the effective group ID is set to GID.  *//* Set the effective user ID of the calling process to UID.  *//* Set the real user ID of the calling process to RUID,
   and the effective user ID of the calling process to EUID.  *//* Set the user ID of the calling process to UID.
   If the calling process is the super-user, set the real
   and effective user IDs, and the saved set-user-ID to UID;
   if not, the effective user ID is set to UID.  *//* Return nonzero iff the calling process is in group GID.  *//* If SIZE is zero, return the number of supplementary groups
   the calling process is in.  Otherwise, fill in the group IDs
   of its supplementary groups in LIST and return the number written.  *//* Get the effective group ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the real group ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the effective user ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the real user ID of the calling process.  *//* Return the session ID of the given process.  *//* Create a new session with the calling process as its leader.
   The process group IDs of the session and the calling process
   are set to the process ID of the calling process, which is returned.  *//* Set the process group ID of the calling process to its own PID.
   This is exactly the same as `setpgid (0, 0)'.  *//* Both System V and BSD have `setpgrp' functions, but with different
   calling conventions.  The BSD function is the same as POSIX.1 `setpgid'
   (above).  The System V function takes no arguments and puts the calling
   process in its on group like `setpgid (0, 0)'.

   New programs should always use `setpgid' instead.

   GNU provides the POSIX.1 function.  *//* Set the process group ID of the process matching PID to PGID.
   If PID is zero, the current process's process group ID is set.
   If PGID is zero, the process ID of the process is used.  *//* Get the process group ID of process PID.  *//* Get the process group ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the process ID of the calling process's parent.  *//* Get the process ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the value of the string-valued system variable NAME.  *//* Get the value of the system variable NAME.  *//* Get file-specific configuration about descriptor FD.  *//* Get file-specific configuration information about PATH.  *//* Get the `_PC_*' symbols for the NAME argument to `pathconf' and `fpathconf';
   the `_SC_*' symbols for the NAME argument to `sysconf';
   and the `_CS_*' symbols for the NAME argument to `confstr'.  *//* Terminate program execution with the low-order 8 bits of STATUS.  *//* Add INC to priority of the current process.  *//* Execute FILE, searching in the `PATH' environment variable if it contains
   no slashes, with arguments ARGV and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute FILE, searching in the `PATH' environment variable if
   it contains no slashes, with all arguments after FILE until a
   NULL pointer and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute PATH with all arguments after PATH until
   a NULL pointer and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute PATH with all arguments after PATH until a NULL pointer,
   and the argument after that for environment.  *//* Execute PATH with arguments ARGV and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute the file FD refers to, overlaying the running program image.
   ARGV and ENVP are passed to the new program, as for `execve'.  *//* Replace the current process, executing PATH with arguments ARGV and
   environment ENVP.  ARGV and ENVP are terminated by NULL pointers.  *//* NULL-terminated array of "NAME=VALUE" environment variables.  *//* Duplicate FD to FD2, closing FD2 and making it open on the same
   file while setting flags according to FLAGS.  *//* Duplicate FD to FD2, closing FD2 and making it open on the same file.  *//* Duplicate FD, returning a new file descriptor on the same file.  *//* Put the absolute pathname of the current working directory in BUF.
   If successful, return BUF.  If not, put an error message in
   BUF and return NULL.  BUF should be at least PATH_MAX bytes long.  *//* Return a malloc'd string containing the current directory name.
   If the environment variable `PWD' is set, and its value is correct,
   that value is used.  *//* Get the pathname of the current working directory,
   and put it in SIZE bytes of BUF.  Returns NULL if the
   directory couldn't be determined or SIZE was too small.
   If successful, returns BUF.  In GNU, if BUF is NULL,
   an array is allocated with `malloc'; the array is SIZE
   bytes long, unless SIZE == 0, in which case it is as
   big as necessary.  *//* Change the process's working directory to the one FD is open on.  *//* Change the process's working directory to PATH.  *//* Change the owner and group of FILE relative to the directory FD is open
   on.  *//* Use X/Open Unix.  *//* Change owner and group of FILE, if it is a symbolic
   link the ownership of the symbolic link is changed.  *//* Change the owner and group of the file that FD is open on.  *//* Change the owner and group of FILE.  *//* Suspend the process until a signal arrives.
   This always returns -1 and sets `errno' to EINTR.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Sleep USECONDS microseconds, or until a signal arrives that is not blocked
   or ignored.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Set an alarm to go off (generating a SIGALRM signal) in VALUE
   microseconds.  If INTERVAL is nonzero, when the alarm goes off, the
   timer is reset to go off every INTERVAL microseconds thereafter.
   Returns the number of microseconds remaining before the alarm.  *//* Make the process sleep for SECONDS seconds, or until a signal arrives
   and is not ignored.  The function returns the number of seconds less
   than SECONDS which it actually slept (thus zero if it slept the full time).
   If a signal handler does a `longjmp' or modifies the handling of the
   SIGALRM signal while inside `sleep' call, the handling of the SIGALRM
   signal afterwards is undefined.  There is no return value to indicate
   error, but if `sleep' returns SECONDS, it probably didn't work.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Schedule an alarm.  In SECONDS seconds, the process will get a SIGALRM.
   If SECONDS is zero, any currently scheduled alarm will be cancelled.
   The function returns the number of seconds remaining until the last
   alarm scheduled would have signaled, or zero if there wasn't one.
   There is no return value to indicate an error, but you can set `errno'
   to 0 and check its value after calling `alarm', and this might tell you.
   The signal may come late due to processor scheduling.  *//* Same as pipe but apply flags passed in FLAGS to the new file
   descriptors.  *//* Create a one-way communication channel (pipe).
   If successful, two file descriptors are stored in PIPEDES;
   bytes written on PIPEDES[1] can be read from PIPEDES[0].
   Returns 0 if successful, -1 if not.  *//* Write N bytes of BUF to FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number written, or -1.  *//* Read NBYTES into BUF from FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number read, -1 for errors
   or 0 for EOF.  *//* Write N bytes of BUF to FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number written, or -1.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Read NBYTES into BUF from FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number read, -1 for errors
   or 0 for EOF.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Write N bytes of BUF to FD.  Return the number written, or -1.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Read NBYTES into BUF from FD.  Return the
   number read, -1 for errors or 0 for EOF.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Close the file descriptor FD.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Move FD's file position to OFFSET bytes from the
   beginning of the file (if WHENCE is SEEK_SET),
   the current position (if WHENCE is SEEK_CUR),
   or the end of the file (if WHENCE is SEEK_END).
   Return the new file position.  *//* Old BSD names for the same constants; just for compatibility.  *//* <stdio.h> has the same definitions.  *//* Values for the WHENCE argument to lseek.  *//* Test for access to FILE relative to the directory FD is open on.
   If AT_EACCESS is set in FLAG, then use effective IDs like `eaccess',
   otherwise use real IDs like `access'.  *//* An alias for `euidaccess', used by some other systems.  *//* Test for access to NAME using the effective UID and GID
   (as normal file operations use).  *//* Test for access to NAME using the real UID and real GID.  *//* Test for existence.  *//* Test for execute permission.  *//* Test for write permission.  *//* Test for read permission.  *//* Values for the second argument to access.
   These may be OR'd together.  *//* X/Open *//* The Single Unix specification says that some more types are
   available here.  *//* All functions that are not declared anywhere else.  *//* Standard error output.  *//* Standard output.  *//* Standard input.  *//* Standard file descriptors.  *//* Get the environment definitions from Unix98.  *//* Get values of POSIX options:

   If these symbols are defined, the corresponding features are
   always available.  If not, they may be available sometimes.
   The current values can be obtained with `sysconf'.

ZEXTERN uLong ZEXPORT crc32_combine OF((uLong crc1, uLong crc2, z_off_t len2));

     Combine two CRC-32 check values into one.  For two sequences of bytes,
   seq1 and seq2 with lengths len1 and len2, CRC-32 check values were
   calculated for each, crc1 and crc2.  crc32_combine() returns the CRC-32
   check value of seq1 and seq2 concatenated, requiring only crc1, crc2, and
   len2.
*//*
     Same as crc32(), but with a size_t length.
*//*
     Update a running CRC-32 with the bytes buf[0..len-1] and return the
   updated CRC-32.  If buf is Z_NULL, this function returns the required
   initial value for the crc.  Pre- and post-conditioning (one's complement) is
   performed within this function so it shouldn't be done by the application.

   Usage example:

     uLong crc = crc32(0L, Z_NULL, 0);

     while (read_buffer(buffer, length) != EOF) {
       crc = crc32(crc, buffer, length);
     }
     if (crc != original_crc) error();
*//*
ZEXTERN uLong ZEXPORT adler32_combine OF((uLong adler1, uLong adler2,
                                          z_off_t len2));

     Combine two Adler-32 checksums into one.  For two sequences of bytes, seq1
   and seq2 with lengths len1 and len2, Adler-32 checksums were calculated for
   each, adler1 and adler2.  adler32_combine() returns the Adler-32 checksum of
   seq1 and seq2 concatenated, requiring only adler1, adler2, and len2.  Note
   that the z_off_t type (like off_t) is a signed integer.  If len2 is
   negative, the result has no meaning or utility.
*//*
     Same as adler32(), but with a size_t length.
*//*
     Update a running Adler-32 checksum with the bytes buf[0..len-1] and
   return the updated checksum.  If buf is Z_NULL, this function returns the
   required initial value for the checksum.

     An Adler-32 checksum is almost as reliable as a CRC-32 but can be computed
   much faster.

   Usage example:

     uLong adler = adler32(0L, Z_NULL, 0);

     while (read_buffer(buffer, length) != EOF) {
       adler = adler32(adler, buffer, length);
     }
     if (adler != original_adler) error();
*//*
     These functions are not related to compression but are exported
   anyway because they might be useful in applications using the compression
   library.
*//* checksum functions *//*
     Clears the error and end-of-file flags for file.  This is analogous to the
   clearerr() function in stdio.  This is useful for continuing to read a gzip
   file that is being written concurrently.
*//*
     Returns the error message for the last error which occurred on the given
   compressed file.  errnum is set to zlib error number.  If an error occurred
   in the file system and not in the compression library, errnum is set to
   Z_ERRNO and the application may consult errno to get the exact error code.

     The application must not modify the returned string.  Future calls to
   this function may invalidate the previously returned string.  If file is
   closed, then the string previously returned by gzerror will no longer be
   available.

     gzerror() should be used to distinguish errors from end-of-file for those
   functions above that do not distinguish those cases in their return values.
*//*
     Same as gzclose(), but gzclose_r() is only for use when reading, and
   gzclose_w() is only for use when writing or appending.  The advantage to
   using these instead of gzclose() is that they avoid linking in zlib
   compression or decompression code that is not used when only reading or only
   writing respectively.  If gzclose() is used, then both compression and
   decompression code will be included the application when linking to a static
   zlib library.
*//*
     Flushes all pending output if necessary, closes the compressed file and
   deallocates the (de)compression state.  Note that once file is closed, you
   cannot call gzerror with file, since its structures have been deallocated.
   gzclose must not be called more than once on the same file, just as free
   must not be called more than once on the same allocation.

     gzclose will return Z_STREAM_ERROR if file is not valid, Z_ERRNO on a
   file operation error, Z_MEM_ERROR if out of memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if the
   last read ended in the middle of a gzip stream, or Z_OK on success.
*//*
     Returns true (1) if file is being copied directly while reading, or false
   (0) if file is a gzip stream being decompressed.

     If the input file is empty, gzdirect() will return true, since the input
   does not contain a gzip stream.

     If gzdirect() is used immediately after gzopen() or gzdopen() it will
   cause buffers to be allocated to allow reading the file to determine if it
   is a gzip file.  Therefore if gzbuffer() is used, it should be called before
   gzdirect().

     When writing, gzdirect() returns true (1) if transparent writing was
   requested ("wT" for the gzopen() mode), or false (0) otherwise.  (Note:
   gzdirect() is not needed when writing.  Transparent writing must be
   explicitly requested, so the application already knows the answer.  When
   linking statically, using gzdirect() will include all of the zlib code for
   gzip file reading and decompression, which may not be desired.)
*//*
     Returns true (1) if the end-of-file indicator has been set while reading,
   false (0) otherwise.  Note that the end-of-file indicator is set only if the
   read tried to go past the end of the input, but came up short.  Therefore,
   just like feof(), gzeof() may return false even if there is no more data to
   read, in the event that the last read request was for the exact number of
   bytes remaining in the input file.  This will happen if the input file size
   is an exact multiple of the buffer size.

     If gzeof() returns true, then the read functions will return no more data,
   unless the end-of-file indicator is reset by gzclearerr() and the input file
   has grown since the previous end of file was detected.
*//*
ZEXTERN z_off_t ZEXPORT gzoffset OF((gzFile file));

     Returns the current offset in the file being read or written.  This offset
   includes the count of bytes that precede the gzip stream, for example when
   appending or when using gzdopen() for reading.  When reading, the offset
   does not include as yet unused buffered input.  This information can be used
   for a progress indicator.  On error, gzoffset() returns -1.
*//*
ZEXTERN z_off_t ZEXPORT    gztell OF((gzFile file));

     Returns the starting position for the next gzread or gzwrite on the given
   compressed file.  This position represents a number of bytes in the
   uncompressed data stream, and is zero when starting, even if appending or
   reading a gzip stream from the middle of a file using gzdopen().

     gztell(file) is equivalent to gzseek(file, 0L, SEEK_CUR)
*//*
     Rewinds the given file. This function is supported only for reading.

     gzrewind(file) is equivalent to (int)gzseek(file, 0L, SEEK_SET)
*//*
ZEXTERN z_off_t ZEXPORT gzseek OF((gzFile file,
                                   z_off_t offset, int whence));

     Sets the starting position for the next gzread or gzwrite on the given
   compressed file.  The offset represents a number of bytes in the
   uncompressed data stream.  The whence parameter is defined as in lseek(2);
   the value SEEK_END is not supported.

     If the file is opened for reading, this function is emulated but can be
   extremely slow.  If the file is opened for writing, only forward seeks are
   supported; gzseek then compresses a sequence of zeroes up to the new
   starting position.

     gzseek returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from
   the beginning of the uncompressed stream, or -1 in case of error, in
   particular if the file is opened for writing and the new starting position
   would be before the current position.
*//*
     Flushes all pending output into the compressed file.  The parameter flush
   is as in the deflate() function.  The return value is the zlib error number
   (see function gzerror below).  gzflush is only permitted when writing.

     If the flush parameter is Z_FINISH, the remaining data is written and the
   gzip stream is completed in the output.  If gzwrite() is called again, a new
   gzip stream will be started in the output.  gzread() is able to read such
   concatenated gzip streams.

     gzflush should be called only when strictly necessary because it will
   degrade compression if called too often.
*//*
     Push one character back onto the stream to be read as the first character
   on the next read.  At least one character of push-back is allowed.
   gzungetc() returns the character pushed, or -1 on failure.  gzungetc() will
   fail if c is -1, and may fail if a character has been pushed but not read
   yet.  If gzungetc is used immediately after gzopen or gzdopen, at least the
   output buffer size of pushed characters is allowed.  (See gzbuffer above.)
   The pushed character will be discarded if the stream is repositioned with
   gzseek() or gzrewind().
*//*
     Reads one byte from the compressed file.  gzgetc returns this byte or -1
   in case of end of file or error.  This is implemented as a macro for speed.
   As such, it does not do all of the checking the other functions do.  I.e.
   it does not check to see if file is NULL, nor whether the structure file
   points to has been clobbered or not.
*//*
     Writes c, converted to an unsigned char, into the compressed file.  gzputc
   returns the value that was written, or -1 in case of error.
*//*
     Reads bytes from the compressed file until len-1 characters are read, or a
   newline character is read and transferred to buf, or an end-of-file
   condition is encountered.  If any characters are read or if len == 1, the
   string is terminated with a null character.  If no characters are read due
   to an end-of-file or len < 1, then the buffer is left untouched.

     gzgets returns buf which is a null-terminated string, or it returns NULL
   for end-of-file or in case of error.  If there was an error, the contents at
   buf are indeterminate.
*//*
     Writes the given null-terminated string to the compressed file, excluding
   the terminating null character.

     gzputs returns the number of characters written, or -1 in case of error.
*//*
     Converts, formats, and writes the arguments to the compressed file under
   control of the format string, as in fprintf.  gzprintf returns the number of
   uncompressed bytes actually written, or a negative zlib error code in case
   of error.  The number of uncompressed bytes written is limited to 8191, or
   one less than the buffer size given to gzbuffer().  The caller should assure
   that this limit is not exceeded.  If it is exceeded, then gzprintf() will
   return an error (0) with nothing written.  In this case, there may also be a
   buffer overflow with unpredictable consequences, which is possible only if
   zlib was compiled with the insecure functions sprintf() or vsprintf()
   because the secure snprintf() or vsnprintf() functions were not available.
   This can be determined using zlibCompileFlags().
*//*
     gzfwrite() writes nitems items of size size from buf to file, duplicating
   the interface of stdio's fwrite(), with size_t request and return types.  If
   the library defines size_t, then z_size_t is identical to size_t.  If not,
   then z_size_t is an unsigned integer type that can contain a pointer.

     gzfwrite() returns the number of full items written of size size, or zero
   if there was an error.  If the multiplication of size and nitems overflows,
   i.e. the product does not fit in a z_size_t, then nothing is written, zero
   is returned, and the error state is set to Z_STREAM_ERROR.
*//*
     Writes the given number of uncompressed bytes into the compressed file.
   gzwrite returns the number of uncompressed bytes written or 0 in case of
   error.
*//*
     Read up to nitems items of size size from file to buf, otherwise operating
   as gzread() does.  This duplicates the interface of stdio's fread(), with
   size_t request and return types.  If the library defines size_t, then
   z_size_t is identical to size_t.  If not, then z_size_t is an unsigned
   integer type that can contain a pointer.

     gzfread() returns the number of full items read of size size, or zero if
   the end of the file was reached and a full item could not be read, or if
   there was an error.  gzerror() must be consulted if zero is returned in
   order to determine if there was an error.  If the multiplication of size and
   nitems overflows, i.e. the product does not fit in a z_size_t, then nothing
   is read, zero is returned, and the error state is set to Z_STREAM_ERROR.

     In the event that the end of file is reached and only a partial item is
   available at the end, i.e. the remaining uncompressed data length is not a
   multiple of size, then the final partial item is nevetheless read into buf
   and the end-of-file flag is set.  The length of the partial item read is not
   provided, but could be inferred from the result of gztell().  This behavior
   is the same as the behavior of fread() implementations in common libraries,
   but it prevents the direct use of gzfread() to read a concurrently written
   file, reseting and retrying on end-of-file, when size is not 1.
*//*
     Reads the given number of uncompressed bytes from the compressed file.  If
   the input file is not in gzip format, gzread copies the given number of
   bytes into the buffer directly from the file.

     After reaching the end of a gzip stream in the input, gzread will continue
   to read, looking for another gzip stream.  Any number of gzip streams may be
   concatenated in the input file, and will all be decompressed by gzread().
   If something other than a gzip stream is encountered after a gzip stream,
   that remaining trailing garbage is ignored (and no error is returned).

     gzread can be used to read a gzip file that is being concurrently written.
   Upon reaching the end of the input, gzread will return with the available
   data.  If the error code returned by gzerror is Z_OK or Z_BUF_ERROR, then
   gzclearerr can be used to clear the end of file indicator in order to permit
   gzread to be tried again.  Z_OK indicates that a gzip stream was completed
   on the last gzread.  Z_BUF_ERROR indicates that the input file ended in the
   middle of a gzip stream.  Note that gzread does not return -1 in the event
   of an incomplete gzip stream.  This error is deferred until gzclose(), which
   will return Z_BUF_ERROR if the last gzread ended in the middle of a gzip
   stream.  Alternatively, gzerror can be used before gzclose to detect this
   case.

     gzread returns the number of uncompressed bytes actually read, less than
   len for end of file, or -1 for error.  If len is too large to fit in an int,
   then nothing is read, -1 is returned, and the error state is set to
   Z_STREAM_ERROR.
*//*
     Dynamically update the compression level or strategy.  See the description
   of deflateInit2 for the meaning of these parameters.  Previously provided
   data is flushed before the parameter change.

     gzsetparams returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the file was not
   opened for writing, Z_ERRNO if there is an error writing the flushed data,
   or Z_MEM_ERROR if there is a memory allocation error.
*//*
     Set the internal buffer size used by this library's functions.  The
   default buffer size is 8192 bytes.  This function must be called after
   gzopen() or gzdopen(), and before any other calls that read or write the
   file.  The buffer memory allocation is always deferred to the first read or
   write.  Three times that size in buffer space is allocated.  A larger buffer
   size of, for example, 64K or 128K bytes will noticeably increase the speed
   of decompression (reading).

     The new buffer size also affects the maximum length for gzprintf().

     gzbuffer() returns 0 on success, or -1 on failure, such as being called
   too late.
*//*
     gzdopen associates a gzFile with the file descriptor fd.  File descriptors
   are obtained from calls like open, dup, creat, pipe or fileno (if the file
   has been previously opened with fopen).  The mode parameter is as in gzopen.

     The next call of gzclose on the returned gzFile will also close the file
   descriptor fd, just like fclose(fdopen(fd, mode)) closes the file descriptor
   fd.  If you want to keep fd open, use fd = dup(fd_keep); gz = gzdopen(fd,
   mode);.  The duplicated descriptor should be saved to avoid a leak, since
   gzdopen does not close fd if it fails.  If you are using fileno() to get the
   file descriptor from a FILE *, then you will have to use dup() to avoid
   double-close()ing the file descriptor.  Both gzclose() and fclose() will
   close the associated file descriptor, so they need to have different file
   descriptors.

     gzdopen returns NULL if there was insufficient memory to allocate the
   gzFile state, if an invalid mode was specified (an 'r', 'w', or 'a' was not
   provided, or '+' was provided), or if fd is -1.  The file descriptor is not
   used until the next gz* read, write, seek, or close operation, so gzdopen
   will not detect if fd is invalid (unless fd is -1).
*//*
ZEXTERN gzFile ZEXPORT gzopen OF((const char *path, const char *mode));

     Opens a gzip (.gz) file for reading or writing.  The mode parameter is as
   in fopen ("rb" or "wb") but can also include a compression level ("wb9") or
   a strategy: 'f' for filtered data as in "wb6f", 'h' for Huffman-only
   compression as in "wb1h", 'R' for run-length encoding as in "wb1R", or 'F'
   for fixed code compression as in "wb9F".  (See the description of
   deflateInit2 for more information about the strategy parameter.)  'T' will
   request transparent writing or appending with no compression and not using
   the gzip format.

     "a" can be used instead of "w" to request that the gzip stream that will
   be written be appended to the file.  "+" will result in an error, since
   reading and writing to the same gzip file is not supported.  The addition of
   "x" when writing will create the file exclusively, which fails if the file
   already exists.  On systems that support it, the addition of "e" when
   reading or writing will set the flag to close the file on an execve() call.

     These functions, as well as gzip, will read and decode a sequence of gzip
   streams in a file.  The append function of gzopen() can be used to create
   such a file.  (Also see gzflush() for another way to do this.)  When
   appending, gzopen does not test whether the file begins with a gzip stream,
   nor does it look for the end of the gzip streams to begin appending.  gzopen
   will simply append a gzip stream to the existing file.

     gzopen can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this
   case gzread will directly read from the file without decompression.  When
   reading, this will be detected automatically by looking for the magic two-
   byte gzip header.

     gzopen returns NULL if the file could not be opened, if there was
   insufficient memory to allocate the gzFile state, or if an invalid mode was
   specified (an 'r', 'w', or 'a' was not provided, or '+' was provided).
   errno can be checked to determine if the reason gzopen failed was that the
   file could not be opened.
*//* semi-opaque gzip file descriptor *//*
     This library supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format with
   an interface similar to that of stdio, using the functions that start with
   "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a gzip
   wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.
*//* gzip file access functions *//*
     Same as uncompress, except that sourceLen is a pointer, where the
   length of the source is *sourceLen.  On return, *sourceLen is the number of
   source bytes consumed.
*//*
     Decompresses the source buffer into the destination buffer.  sourceLen is
   the byte length of the source buffer.  Upon entry, destLen is the total size
   of the destination buffer, which must be large enough to hold the entire
   uncompressed data.  (The size of the uncompressed data must have been saved
   previously by the compressor and transmitted to the decompressor by some

     All memory allocated by inflateBackInit() is freed.

     inflateBackEnd() returns Z_OK on success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream
   state was inconsistent.
*//*
     inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back
   interface for input and output.  This is potentially more efficient than
   inflate() for file i/o applications, in that it avoids copying between the
   output and the sliding window by simply making the window itself the output
   buffer.  inflate() can be faster on modern CPUs when used with large
   buffers.  inflateBack() trusts the application to not change the output
   buffer passed by the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns.

     inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state
   and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer.
   inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw
   deflate stream with each call.  inflateBackEnd() is then called to free the
   allocated state.

     A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer.
   This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip
   files and writes out uncompressed files.  The utility would decode the
   header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only
   the raw deflate stream to decompress.  This is different from the default
   behavior of inflate(), which expects a zlib header and trailer around the
   deflate stream.

     inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then
   called by inflateBack() for input and output.  inflateBack() calls those
   routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the
   uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error.  The function's
   parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func
   typedefs.  inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the
   number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf.  If
   there is no input available, in() must return zero -- buf is ignored in that
   case -- and inflateBack() will return a buffer error.  inflateBack() will
   call out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len-1].
   out() should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure.  If out()
   returns non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error.  Neither in() nor
   out() are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to
   inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from.
   The length written by out() will be at most the window size.  Any non-zero
   amount of input may be provided by in().

     For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by
   setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in.  If that input is exhausted, then
   in() will be called.  Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before
   calling inflateBack().  If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called
   immediately for input.  If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in
   must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will
   initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 ..  strm->avail_in - 1].

     The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the
   first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called.  These
   descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller-
   supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job.

     On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to
   pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call.  The
   return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR
   if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format error
   in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the nature
   of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly initialized.
   In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be distinguished
   using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned an error.  If
   strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to out() returning
   non-zero.  (in() will always be called before out(), so strm->next_in is
   assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.)  Note that inflateBack()
   cannot return Z_OK.
*//*
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateBackInit OF((z_streamp strm, int windowBits,
                                        unsigned char FAR *window));

     Initialize the internal stream state for decompression using inflateBack()
   calls.  The fields zalloc, zfree and opaque in strm must be initialized
   before the call.  If zalloc and zfree are Z_NULL, then the default library-
   derived memory allocation routines are used.  windowBits is the base two
   logarithm of the window size, in the range 8..15.  window is a caller
   supplied buffer of that size.  Except for special applications where it is
   assured that deflate was used with small window sizes, windowBits must be 15
   and a 32K byte window must be supplied to be able to decompress general
   deflate streams.

     See inflateBack() for the usage of these routines.

     inflateBackInit will return Z_OK on success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any of
   the parameters are invalid, Z_MEM_ERROR if the internal state could not be
   allocated, or Z_VERSION_ERROR if the version of the library does not match
   the version of the header file.
*//*
     inflateGetHeader() requests that gzip header information be stored in the
   provided gz_header structure.  inflateGetHeader() may be called after
   inflateInit2() or inflateReset(), and before the first call of inflate().
   As inflate() processes the gzip stream, head->done is zero until the header
   is completed, at which time head->done is set to one.  If a zlib stream is
   being decoded, then head->done is set to -1 to indicate that there will be
   no gzip header information forthcoming.  Note that Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES can be
   used to force inflate() to return immediately after header processing is
   complete and before any actual data is decompressed.

     The text, time, xflags, and os fields are filled in with the gzip header
   contents.  hcrc is set to true if there is a header CRC.  (The header CRC
   was valid if done is set to one.) If extra is not Z_NULL, then extra_max
   contains the maximum number of bytes to write to extra.  Once done is true,
   extra_len contains the actual extra field length, and extra contains the
   extra field, or that field truncated if extra_max is less than extra_len.
   If name is not Z_NULL, then up to name_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than name_max.  If
   comment is not Z_NULL, then up to comm_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than comm_max.  When any
   of extra, name, or comment are not Z_NULL and the respective field is not
   present in the header, then that field is set to Z_NULL to signal its
   absence.  This allows the use of deflateSetHeader() with the returned
   structure to duplicate the header.  However if those fields are set to
   allocated memory, then the application will need to save those pointers
   elsewhere so that they can be eventually freed.

     If inflateGetHeader is not used, then the header information is simply
   discarded.  The header is always checked for validity, including the header
   CRC if present.  inflateReset() will reset the process to discard the header
   information.  The application would need to call inflateGetHeader() again to
   retrieve the header from the next gzip stream.

     inflateGetHeader returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     This function returns two values, one in the lower 16 bits of the return
   value, and the other in the remaining upper bits, obtained by shifting the
   return value down 16 bits.  If the upper value is -1 and the lower value is
   zero, then inflate() is currently decoding information outside of a block.
   If the upper value is -1 and the lower value is non-zero, then inflate is in
   the middle of a stored block, with the lower value equaling the number of
   bytes from the input remaining to copy.  If the upper value is not -1, then
   it is the number of bits back from the current bit position in the input of
   the code (literal or length/distance pair) currently being processed.  In
   that case the lower value is the number of bytes already emitted for that
   code.

     A code is being processed if inflate is waiting for more input to complete
   decoding of the code, or if it has completed decoding but is waiting for
   more output space to write the literal or match data.

     inflateMark() is used to mark locations in the input data for random
   access, which may be at bit positions, and to note those cases where the
   output of a code may span boundaries of random access blocks.  The current
   location in the input stream can be determined from avail_in and data_type
   as noted in the description for the Z_BLOCK flush parameter for inflate.

     inflateMark returns the value noted above, or -65536 if the provided
   source stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     This function inserts bits in the inflate input stream.  The intent is
   that this function is used to start inflating at a bit position in the
   middle of a byte.  The provided bits will be used before any bytes are used
   from next_in.  This function should only be used with raw inflate, and
   should be used before the first inflate() call after inflateInit2() or
   inflateReset().  bits must be less than or equal to 16, and that many of the
   least significant bits of value will be inserted in the input.

     If bits is negative, then the input stream bit buffer is emptied.  Then
   inflatePrime() can be called again to put bits in the buffer.  This is used
   to clear out bits leftover after feeding inflate a block description prior
   to feeding inflate codes.

     inflatePrime returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     This function is the same as inflateReset, but it also permits changing
   the wrap and window size requests.  The windowBits parameter is interpreted
   the same as it is for inflateInit2.  If the window size is changed, then the
   memory allocated for the window is freed, and the window will be reallocated
   by inflate() if needed.

     inflateReset2 returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent (such as zalloc or state being Z_NULL), or if
   the windowBits parameter is invalid.
*//*
     This function is equivalent to inflateEnd followed by inflateInit,
   but does not free and reallocate the internal decompression state.  The
   stream will keep attributes that may have been set by inflateInit2.

     inflateReset returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent (such as zalloc or state being Z_NULL).
*//*
     Sets the destination stream as a complete copy of the source stream.

     This function can be useful when randomly accessing a large stream.  The
   first pass through the stream can periodically record the inflate state,
   allowing restarting inflate at those points when randomly accessing the
   stream.

     inflateCopy returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source stream state was inconsistent
   (such as zalloc being Z_NULL).  msg is left unchanged in both source and
   destination.
*//*
     Skips invalid compressed data until a possible full flush point (see above
   for the description of deflate with Z_FULL_FLUSH) can be found, or until all
   available input is skipped.  No output is provided.

     inflateSync searches for a 00 00 FF FF pattern in the compressed data.
   All full flush points have this pattern, but not all occurrences of this
   pattern are full flush points.

     inflateSync returns Z_OK if a possible full flush point has been found,
   Z_BUF_ERROR if no more input was provided, Z_DATA_ERROR if no flush point
   has been found, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent.
   In the success case, the application may save the current current value of
   total_in which indicates where valid compressed data was found.  In the
   error case, the application may repeatedly call inflateSync, providing more
   input each time, until success or end of the input data.
*//*
     Returns the sliding dictionary being maintained by inflate.  dictLength is
   set to the number of bytes in the dictionary, and that many bytes are copied
   to dictionary.  dictionary must have enough space, where 32768 bytes is
   always enough.  If inflateGetDictionary() is called with dictionary equal to
   Z_NULL, then only the dictionary length is returned, and nothing is copied.
   Similary, if dictLength is Z_NULL, then it is not set.

     inflateGetDictionary returns Z_OK on success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   stream state is inconsistent.
*//*
     Initializes the decompression dictionary from the given uncompressed byte
   sequence.  This function must be called immediately after a call of inflate,
   if that call returned Z_NEED_DICT.  The dictionary chosen by the compressor
   can be determined from the Adler-32 value returned by that call of inflate.
   The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same dictionary (see
   deflateSetDictionary).  For raw inflate, this function can be called at any
   time to set the dictionary.  If the provided dictionary is smaller than the
   window and there is already data in the window, then the provided dictionary
   will amend what's there.  The application must insure that the dictionary
   that was used for compression is provided.

     inflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (e.g.  dictionary being Z_NULL) or the stream state is
   inconsistent, Z_DATA_ERROR if the given dictionary doesn't match the
   expected one (incorrect Adler-32 value).  inflateSetDictionary does not
   perform any decompression: this will be done by subsequent calls of
   inflate().
*//*
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateInit2 OF((z_streamp strm,
                                     int  windowBits));

     This is another version of inflateInit with an extra parameter.  The
   fields next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized
   before by the caller.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for
   this version of the library.  The default value is 15 if inflateInit is used
   instead.  windowBits must be greater than or equal to the windowBits value
   provided to deflateInit2() while compressing, or it must be equal to 15 if
   deflateInit2() was not used.  If a compressed stream with a larger window
   size is given as input, inflate() will return with the error code
   Z_DATA_ERROR instead of trying to allocate a larger window.

     windowBits can also be zero to request that inflate use the window size in
   the zlib header of the compressed stream.

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate.  In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size.  inflate() will then process raw deflate data,
   not looking for a zlib or gzip header, not generating a check value, and not
   looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream.  This
   is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format
   such as zip.  Those formats provide their own check values.  If a custom
   format is developed using the raw deflate format for compressed data, it is
   recommended that a check value such as an Adler-32 or a CRC-32 be applied to
   the uncompressed data as is done in the zlib, gzip, and zip formats.  For
   most applications, the zlib format should be used as is.  Note that comments
   above on the use in deflateInit2() applies to the magnitude of windowBits.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip decoding.  Add
   32 to windowBits to enable zlib and gzip decoding with automatic header
   detection, or add 16 to decode only the gzip format (the zlib format will
   return a Z_DATA_ERROR).  If a gzip stream is being decoded, strm->adler is a
   CRC-32 instead of an Adler-32.  Unlike the gunzip utility and gzread() (see
   below), inflate() will not automatically decode concatenated gzip streams.
   inflate() will return Z_STREAM_END at the end of the gzip stream.  The state
   would need to be reset to continue decoding a subsequent gzip stream.

     inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the parameters are
   invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure.  msg is set to null if
   there is no error message.  inflateInit2 does not perform any decompression
   apart from possibly reading the zlib header if present: actual decompression
   will be done by inflate().  (So next_in and avail_in may be modified, but
   next_out and avail_out are unused and unchanged.) The current implementation
   of inflateInit2() does not process any header information -- that is
   deferred until inflate() is called.
*//*
     deflateSetHeader() provides gzip header information for when a gzip
   stream is requested by deflateInit2().  deflateSetHeader() may be called
   after deflateInit2() or deflateReset() and before the first call of
   deflate().  The text, time, os, extra field, name, and comment information
   in the provided gz_header structure are written to the gzip header (xflag is
   ignored -- the extra flags are set according to the compression level).  The
   caller must assure that, if not Z_NULL, name and comment are terminated with
   a zero byte, and that if extra is not Z_NULL, that extra_len bytes are
   available there.  If hcrc is true, a gzip header crc is included.  Note that
   the current versions of the command-line version of gzip (up through version
   1.3.x) do not support header crc's, and will report that it is a "multi-part
   gzip file" and give up.

     If deflateSetHeader is not used, the default gzip header has text false,
   the time set to zero, and os set to 255, with no extra, name, or comment
   fields.  The gzip header is returned to the default state by deflateReset().

     deflateSetHeader returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     deflatePrime() inserts bits in the deflate output stream.  The intent
   is that this function is used to start off the deflate output with the bits
   leftover from a previous deflate stream when appending to it.  As such, this
   function can only be used for raw deflate, and must be used before the first
   deflate() call after a deflateInit2() or deflateReset().  bits must be less
   than or equal to 16, and that many of the least significant bits of value
   will be inserted in the output.

     deflatePrime returns Z_OK if success, Z_BUF_ERROR if there was not enough
   room in the internal buffer to insert the bits, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   source stream state was inconsistent.
*//*
     deflatePending() returns the number of bytes and bits of output that have
   been generated, but not yet provided in the available output.  The bytes not
   provided would be due to the available output space having being consumed.
   The number of bits of output not provided are between 0 and 7, where they
   await more bits to join them in order to fill out a full byte.  If pending
   or bits are Z_NULL, then those values are not set.

     deflatePending returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.
 *//*
     deflateBound() returns an upper bound on the compressed size after
   deflation of sourceLen bytes.  It must be called after deflateInit() or
   deflateInit2(), and after deflateSetHeader(), if used.  This would be used
   to allocate an output buffer for deflation in a single pass, and so would be
   called before deflate().  If that first deflate() call is provided the
   sourceLen input bytes, an output buffer allocated to the size returned by
   deflateBound(), and the flush value Z_FINISH, then deflate() is guaranteed
   to return Z_STREAM_END.  Note that it is possible for the compressed size to
   be larger than the value returned by deflateBound() if flush options other
   than Z_FINISH or Z_NO_FLUSH are used.
*//*
     Fine tune deflate's internal compression parameters.  This should only be
   used by someone who understands the algorithm used by zlib's deflate for
   searching for the best matching string, and even then only by the most
   fanatic optimizer trying to squeeze out the last compressed bit for their
   specific input data.  Read the deflate.c source code for the meaning of the
   max_lazy, good_length, nice_length, and max_chain parameters.

     deflateTune() can be called after deflateInit() or deflateInit2(), and
   returns Z_OK on success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR for an invalid deflate stream.
 *//*
     Dynamically update the compression level and compression strategy.  The
   interpretation of level and strategy is as in deflateInit2().  This can be
   used to switch between compression and straight copy of the input data, or
   to switch to a different kind of input data requiring a different strategy.
   If the compression approach (which is a function of the level) or the
   strategy is changed, and if there have been any deflate() calls since the
   state was initialized or reset, then the input available so far is
   compressed with the old level and strategy using deflate(strm, Z_BLOCK).
   There are three approaches for the compression levels 0, 1..3, and 4..9
   respectively.  The new level and strategy will take effect at the next call
   of deflate().

     If a deflate(strm, Z_BLOCK) is performed by deflateParams(), and it does
   not have enough output space to complete, then the parameter change will not
   take effect.  In this case, deflateParams() can be called again with the
   same parameters and more output space to try again.

     In order to assure a change in the parameters on the first try, the
   deflate stream should be flushed using deflate() with Z_BLOCK or other flush
   request until strm.avail_out is not zero, before calling deflateParams().
   Then no more input data should be provided before the deflateParams() call.
   If this is done, the old level and strategy will be applied to the data
   compressed before deflateParams(), and the new level and strategy will be
   applied to the the data compressed after deflateParams().

     deflateParams returns Z_OK on success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source stream
   state was inconsistent or if a parameter was invalid, or Z_BUF_ERROR if
   there was not enough output space to complete the compression of the
   available input data before a change in the strategy or approach.  Note that
   in the case of a Z_BUF_ERROR, the parameters are not changed.  A return
   value of Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, in which case deflateParams() can be
   retried with more output space.
*//*
     This function is equivalent to deflateEnd followed by deflateInit, but
   does not free and reallocate the internal compression state.  The stream
   will leave the compression level and any other attributes that may have been
   set unchanged.

     deflateReset returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent (such as zalloc or state being Z_NULL).
*//*
     Sets the destination stream as a complete copy of the source stream.

     This function can be useful when several compression strategies will be
   tried, for example when there are several ways of pre-processing the input
   data with a filter.  The streams that will be discarded should then be freed
   by calling deflateEnd.  Note that deflateCopy duplicates the internal
   compression state which can be quite large, so this strategy is slow and can
   consume lots of memory.

     deflateCopy returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source stream state was inconsistent
   (such as zalloc being Z_NULL).  msg is left unchanged in both source and
   destination.
*//*
     Returns the sliding dictionary being maintained by deflate.  dictLength is
   set to the number of bytes in the dictionary, and that many bytes are copied
   to dictionary.  dictionary must have enough space, where 32768 bytes is
   always enough.  If deflateGetDictionary() is called with dictionary equal to
   Z_NULL, then only the dictionary length is returned, and nothing is copied.
   Similary, if dictLength is Z_NULL, then it is not set.

     deflateGetDictionary() may return a length less than the window size, even
   when more than the window size in input has been provided. It may return up
   to 258 bytes less in that case, due to how zlib's implementation of deflate
   manages the sliding window and lookahead for matches, where matches can be
   up to 258 bytes long. If the application needs the last window-size bytes of
   input, then that would need to be saved by the application outside of zlib.

     deflateGetDictionary returns Z_OK on success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   stream state is inconsistent.
*//*
     Initializes the compression dictionary from the given byte sequence
   without producing any compressed output.  When using the zlib format, this
   function must be called immediately after deflateInit, deflateInit2 or
   deflateReset, and before any call of deflate.  When doing raw deflate, this
   function must be called either before any call of deflate, or immediately
   after the completion of a deflate block, i.e. after all input has been
   consumed and all output has been delivered when using any of the flush
   options Z_BLOCK, Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, or Z_FULL_FLUSH.  The
   compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same dictionary (see
   inflateSetDictionary).

     The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely
   to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly
   used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary.  Using a
   dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be
   predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than
   with the default empty dictionary.

     Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by
   deflateInit or deflateInit2, a part of the dictionary may in effect be
   discarded, for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size
   provided in deflateInit or deflateInit2.  Thus the strings most likely to be
   useful should be put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front.  In
   addition, the current implementation of deflate will use at most the window
   size minus 262 bytes of the provided dictionary.

     Upon return of this function, strm->adler is set to the Adler-32 value
   of the dictionary; the decompressor may later use this value to determine
   which dictionary has been used by the compressor.  (The Adler-32 value
   applies to the whole dictionary even if only a subset of the dictionary is
   actually used by the compressor.) If a raw deflate was requested, then the
   Adler-32 value is not computed and strm->adler is not set.

     deflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (e.g.  dictionary being Z_NULL) or the stream state is
   inconsistent (for example if deflate has already been called for this stream
   or if not at a block boundary for raw deflate).  deflateSetDictionary does
   not perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflateInit2 OF((z_streamp strm,
                                     int  level,
                                     int  method,
                                     int  windowBits,
                                     int  memLevel,
                                     int  strategy));

     This is another version of deflateInit with more compression options.  The
   fields next_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by the
   caller.

     The method parameter is the compression method.  It must be Z_DEFLATED in
   this version of the library.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the window size
   (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for this
   version of the library.  Larger values of this parameter result in better
   compression at the expense of memory usage.  The default value is 15 if
   deflateInit is used instead.

     For the current implementation of deflate(), a windowBits value of 8 (a
   window size of 256 bytes) is not supported.  As a result, a request for 8
   will result in 9 (a 512-byte window).  In that case, providing 8 to
   inflateInit2() will result in an error when the zlib header with 9 is
   checked against the initialization of inflate().  The remedy is to not use 8
   with deflateInit2() with this initialization, or at least in that case use 9
   with inflateInit2().

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw deflate.  In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size.  deflate() will then generate raw deflate data
   with no zlib header or trailer, and will not compute a check value.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip encoding.  Add
   16 to windowBits to write a simple gzip header and trailer around the
   compressed data instead of a zlib wrapper.  The gzip header will have no
   file name, no extra data, no comment, no modification time (set to zero), no
   header crc, and the operating system will be set to the appropriate value,
   if the operating system was determined at compile time.  If a gzip stream is
   being written, strm->adler is a CRC-32 instead of an Adler-32.

     For raw deflate or gzip encoding, a request for a 256-byte window is
   rejected as invalid, since only the zlib header provides a means of
   transmitting the window size to the decompressor.

     The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated
   for the internal compression state.  memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but is
   slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory for
   optimal speed.  The default value is 8.  See zconf.h for total memory usage
   as a function of windowBits and memLevel.

     The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm.  Use the
   value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data produced by a
   filter (or predictor), Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only (no
   string match), or Z_RLE to limit match distances to one (run-length
   encoding).  Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a somewhat
   random distribution.  In this case, the compression algorithm is tuned to
   compress them better.  The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more Huffman
   coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between
   Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY.  Z_RLE is designed to be almost as
   fast as Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY, but give better compression for PNG image data.  The
   strategy parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the
   correctness of the compressed output even if it is not set appropriately.
   Z_FIXED prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes, allowing for a simpler
   decoder for special applications.

     deflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any parameter is invalid (such as an invalid
   method), or Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version (zlib_version) is
   incompatible with the version assumed by the caller (ZLIB_VERSION).  msg is
   set to null if there is no error message.  deflateInit2 does not perform any
   compression: this will be done by deflate().
*//*
    The following functions are needed only in some special applications.
*//* Advanced functions *//*
     All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.
   This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any pending
   output.

     inflateEnd returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state
   was inconsistent.
*//*
    inflate decompresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full.  It may introduce
  some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

  The detailed semantics are as follows.  inflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Decompress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly.  If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), then next_in and avail_in are updated
    accordingly, and processing will resume at this point for the next call of
    inflate().

  - Generate more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  inflate() provides as much output as possible, until there is
    no more input data or no more space in the output buffer (see below about
    the flush parameter).

    Before the call of inflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming more
  output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.  If the
  caller of inflate() does not provide both available input and available
  output space, it is possible that there will be no progress made.  The
  application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for example
  when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each call of
  inflate().  If inflate returns Z_OK and with zero avail_out, it must be
  called again after making room in the output buffer because there might be
  more output pending.

    The flush parameter of inflate() can be Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, Z_FINISH,
  Z_BLOCK, or Z_TREES.  Z_SYNC_FLUSH requests that inflate() flush as much
  output as possible to the output buffer.  Z_BLOCK requests that inflate()
  stop if and when it gets to the next deflate block boundary.  When decoding
  the zlib or gzip format, this will cause inflate() to return immediately
  after the header and before the first block.  When doing a raw inflate,
  inflate() will go ahead and process the first block, and will return when it
  gets to the end of that block, or when it runs out of data.

    The Z_BLOCK option assists in appending to or combining deflate streams.
  To assist in this, on return inflate() always sets strm->data_type to the
  number of unused bits in the last byte taken from strm->next_in, plus 64 if
  inflate() is currently decoding the last block in the deflate stream, plus
  128 if inflate() returned immediately after decoding an end-of-block code or
  decoding the complete header up to just before the first byte of the deflate
  stream.  The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the uncompressed
  data from that block has been written to strm->next_out.  The number of
  unused bits may in general be greater than seven, except when bit 7 of
  data_type is set, in which case the number of unused bits will be less than
  eight.  data_type is set as noted here every time inflate() returns for all
  flush options, and so can be used to determine the amount of currently
  consumed input in bits.

    The Z_TREES option behaves as Z_BLOCK does, but it also returns when the
  end of each deflate block header is reached, before any actual data in that
  block is decoded.  This allows the caller to determine the length of the
  deflate block header for later use in random access within a deflate block.
  256 is added to the value of strm->data_type when inflate() returns
  immediately after reaching the end of the deflate block header.

    inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an
  error.  However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step (a
  single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to Z_FINISH.  In
  this case all pending input is processed and all pending output is flushed;
  avail_out must be large enough to hold all of the uncompressed data for the
  operation to complete.  (The size of the uncompressed data may have been
  saved by the compressor for this purpose.)  The use of Z_FINISH is not
  required to perform an inflation in one step.  However it may be used to
  inform inflate that a faster approach can be used for the single inflate()
  call.  Z_FINISH also informs inflate to not maintain a sliding window if the
  stream completes, which reduces inflate's memory footprint.  If the stream
  does not complete, either because not all of the stream is provided or not
  enough output space is provided, then a sliding window will be allocated and
  inflate() can be called again to continue the operation as if Z_NO_FLUSH had
  been used.

     In this implementation, inflate() always flushes as much output as
  possible to the output buffer, and always uses the faster approach on the
  first call.  So the effects of the flush parameter in this implementation are
  on the return value of inflate() as noted below, when inflate() returns early
  when Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES is used, and when inflate() avoids the allocation of
  memory for a sliding window when Z_FINISH is used.

     If a preset dictionary is needed after this call (see inflateSetDictionary
  below), inflate sets strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of the dictionary
  chosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise it sets
  strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of all output produced so far (that is,
  total_out bytes) and returns Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END or an error code as described
  below.  At the end of the stream, inflate() checks that its computed Adler-32
  checksum is equal to that saved by the compressor and returns Z_STREAM_END
  only if the checksum is correct.

    inflate() can decompress and check either zlib-wrapped or gzip-wrapped
  deflate data.  The header type is detected automatically, if requested when
  initializing with inflateInit2().  Any information contained in the gzip
  header is not retained unless inflateGetHeader() is used.  When processing
  gzip-wrapped deflate data, strm->adler32 is set to the CRC-32 of the output
  produced so far.  The CRC-32 is checked against the gzip trailer, as is the
  uncompressed length, modulo 2^32.

    inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed
  or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the compressed data has
  been reached and all uncompressed output has been produced, Z_NEED_DICT if a
  preset dictionary is needed at this point, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was
  corrupted (input stream not conforming to the zlib format or incorrect check
  value, in which case strm->msg points to a string with a more specific
  error), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent (for example
  next_in or next_out was Z_NULL, or the state was inadvertently written over
  by the application), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory, Z_BUF_ERROR
  if no progress was possible or if there was not enough room in the output
  buffer when Z_FINISH is used.  Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, and
  inflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to
  continue decompressing.  If Z_DATA_ERROR is returned, the application may
  then call inflateSync() to look for a good compression block if a partial
  recovery of the data is to be attempted.
*//*
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateInit OF((z_streamp strm));

     Initializes the internal stream state for decompression.  The fields
   next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by
   the caller.  In the current version of inflate, the provided input is not
   read or consumed.  The allocation of a sliding window will be deferred to
   the first call of inflate (if the decompression does not complete on the
   first call).  If zalloc and zfree are set to Z_NULL, inflateInit updates
   them to use default allocation functions.

     inflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the parameters are
   invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure.  msg is set to null if
   there is no error message.  inflateInit does not perform any decompression.
   Actual decompression will be done by inflate().  So next_in, and avail_in,
   next_out, and avail_out are unused and unchanged.  The current
   implementation of inflateInit() does not process any header information --
   that is deferred until inflate() is called.
*//*
     All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.
   This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any pending
   output.

     deflateEnd returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   stream state was inconsistent, Z_DATA_ERROR if the stream was freed
   prematurely (some input or output was discarded).  In the error case, msg
   may be set but then points to a static string (which must not be
   deallocated).
*//*
    deflate compresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full.  It may introduce
  some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

    The detailed semantics are as follows.  deflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Compress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly.  If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and
    processing will resume at this point for the next call of deflate().

  - Generate more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  This action is forced if the parameter flush is non zero.
    Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter
    should be set only when necessary.  Some output may be provided even if
    flush is zero.

    Before the call of deflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming more
  output, and updating avail_in or avail_out accordingly; avail_out should
  never be zero before the call.  The application can consume the compressed
  output when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full (avail_out
  == 0), or after each call of deflate().  If deflate returns Z_OK and with
  zero avail_out, it must be called again after making room in the output
  buffer because there might be more output pending. See deflatePending(),
  which can be used if desired to determine whether or not there is more ouput
  in that case.

    Normally the parameter flush is set to Z_NO_FLUSH, which allows deflate to
  decide how much data to accumulate before producing output, in order to
  maximize compression.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_SYNC_FLUSH, all pending output is
  flushed to the output buffer and the output is aligned on a byte boundary, so
  that the decompressor can get all input data available so far.  (In
  particular avail_in is zero after the call if enough output space has been
  provided before the call.) Flushing may degrade compression for some
  compression algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary.  This
  completes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty stored block
  that is three bits plus filler bits to the next byte, followed by four bytes
  (00 00 ff ff).

    If flush is set to Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, all pending output is flushed to the
  output buffer, but the output is not aligned to a byte boundary.  All of the
  input data so far will be available to the decompressor, as for Z_SYNC_FLUSH.
  This completes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty fixed
  codes block that is 10 bits long.  This assures that enough bytes are output
  in order for the decompressor to finish the block before the empty fixed
  codes block.

    If flush is set to Z_BLOCK, a deflate block is completed and emitted, as
  for Z_SYNC_FLUSH, but the output is not aligned on a byte boundary, and up to
  seven bits of the current block are held to be written as the next byte after
  the next deflate block is completed.  In this case, the decompressor may not
  be provided enough bits at this point in order to complete decompression of
  the data provided so far to the compressor.  It may need to wait for the next
  block to be emitted.  This is for advanced applications that need to control
  the emission of deflate blocks.

    If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with
  Z_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can
  restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if
  random access is desired.  Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade
  compression.

    If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again
  with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated
  avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero
  avail_out).  In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that
  avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to
  avail_out == 0 on return.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed,
  pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was
  enough output space.  If deflate returns with Z_OK or Z_BUF_ERROR, this
  function must be called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated
  avail_out) but no more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an
  error.  After deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations
  on the stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd.

    Z_FINISH can be used in the first deflate call after deflateInit if all the
  compression is to be done in a single step.  In order to complete in one
  call, avail_out must be at least the value returned by deflateBound (see
  below).  Then deflate is guaranteed to return Z_STREAM_END.  If not enough
  output space is provided, deflate will not return Z_STREAM_END, and it must
  be called again as described above.

    deflate() sets strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of all input read
  so far (that is, total_in bytes).  If a gzip stream is being generated, then
  strm->adler will be the CRC-32 checksum of the input read so far.  (See
  deflateInit2 below.)

    deflate() may update strm->data_type if it can make a good guess about
  the input data type (Z_BINARY or Z_TEXT).  If in doubt, the data is
  considered binary.  This field is only for information purposes and does not
  affect the compression algorithm in any manner.

    deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been
  consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to
  Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example
  if next_in or next_out was Z_NULL or the state was inadvertently written over
  by the application), or Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible (for example
  avail_in or avail_out was zero).  Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, and
  deflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to
  continue compressing.
*//*
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflateInit OF((z_streamp strm, int level));

     Initializes the internal stream state for compression.  The fields
   zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by the caller.  If
   zalloc and zfree are set to Z_NULL, deflateInit updates them to use default
   allocation functions.

     The compression level must be Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION, or between 0 and 9:
   1 gives best speed, 9 gives best compression, 0 gives no compression at all
   (the input data is simply copied a block at a time).  Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION
   requests a default compromise between speed and compression (currently
   equivalent to level 6).

     deflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if level is not a valid compression level, or
   Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version (zlib_version) is incompatible
   with the version assumed by the caller (ZLIB_VERSION).  msg is set to null
   if there is no error message.  deflateInit does not perform any compression:
   this will be done by deflate().
*//* The application can compare zlibVersion and ZLIB_VERSION for consistency.

     The application must update next_in and avail_in when avail_in has dropped
   to zero.  It must update next_out and avail_out when avail_out has dropped
   to zero.  The application must initialize zalloc, zfree and opaque before
   calling the init function.  All other fields are set by the compression
   library and must not be updated by the application.

     The opaque value provided by the application will be passed as the first
   parameter for calls of zalloc and zfree.  This can be useful for custom
   memory management.  The compression library attaches no meaning to the
   opaque value.

     zalloc must return Z_NULL if there is not enough memory for the object.
   If zlib is used in a multi-threaded application, zalloc and zfree must be
   thread safe.  In that case, zlib is thread-safe.  When zalloc and zfree are
   Z_NULL on entry to the initialization function, they are set to internal
   routines that use the standard library functions malloc() and free().

     On 16-bit systems, the functions zalloc and zfree must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this if
   the symbol MAXSEG_64K is defined (see zconf.h).  WARNING: On MSDOS, pointers
   returned by zalloc for objects of exactly 65536 bytes *must* have their
   offset normalized to zero.  The default allocation function provided by this
   library ensures this (see zutil.c).  To reduce memory requirements and avoid
   any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of compression ratio, compile
   the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.h).

     The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or progress
   reports.  After compression, total_in holds the total size of the
   uncompressed data and may be saved for use by the decompressor (particularly
   if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in a single step).

    The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
  This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation)
  but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same stream
  interface.

    Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough,
  or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter
  case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

    The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
  the zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
  around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.

    The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
  with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
  gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

    This library can optionally read and write gzip and raw deflate streams in
  memory as well.

    The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
  and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
  file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
  directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.

    The library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash
  even in the case of corrupted input.

    *//* Supply the input and output sample depths here - 8 for an indexed image,

    * the output (screen) gamma and thirdly the output file encoding.
    *
    * Since this API receives the screen and file gamma in double
    * precision it is possible to calculate an exact answer given an input
    * pixel value.  Therefore we assume that the *input* value is exact -
    * sample/maxsample - calculate the corresponding gamma corrected
    * output to the limits of double precision arithmetic and compare with
    * what libpng returns.
    *
    * Since the library must quantize the output to 8 or 16 bits there is
    * a fundamental limit on the accuracy of the output of +/-.5 - this
    * quantization limit is included in addition to the other limits
    * specified by the parameters to the API.  (Effectively, add .5
    * everywhere.)
    *
    * The behavior of the 'sbit' parameter is defined by section 12.5
    * (sample depth scaling) of the PNG spec.  That section forces the
    * decoder to assume that the PNG values have been scaled if sBIT is
    * present:
    *
    *     png-sample = floor( input-sample * (max-out/max-in) + .5);
    *
    * This means that only a subset of the possible PNG values should
    * appear in the input. However, the spec allows the encoder to use a
    * variety of approximations to the above and doesn't require any
    * restriction of the values produced.
    *
    * Nevertheless the spec requires that the upper 'sBIT' bits of the
    * value stored in a PNG file be the original sample bits.
    * Consequently the code below simply scales the top sbit bits by
    * (1<<sbit)-1 to obtain an original sample value.
    *
    * Because there is limited precision in the input it is arguable that
    * an acceptable result is any valid result from input-.5 to input+.5.
    * The basic tests below do not do this, however if 'use_input_precision'
    * is set a subsequent test is performed above.

                *//* logging *//* Finally report the output gamma encoding, if any. *//* Report the calculated value (input_sample) and the linearized

             *//* Now record the *linear* background value if it was used
                * (this function is not passed the original, non-linear,
                * value but it is contained in the test name.)
                *//* If any form of composition is being done report our
                * calculated linear value here (the code above doesn't record
                * the input value before composition is performed, so what

                *//* A component may have been multiplied (in linear space) by the

                   * but at present the presence of gamma correction effectively
                   * prevents the errors in the component scaling (I don't quite
                   * understand why, but since it's better this way I care not
                   * to ask, JB 20110419.)
                   *//* One last chance.  If this is an alpha channel and the 16to8

             *
             * This is only done for older libpng versions when the 'inaccurate'

             *//* Ok, something is wrong - this actually happens in current libpng
             * 16-to-8 processing.  Assume that the input value (id, adjusted

             * NOTE: at present because the libpng gamma table stuff has been

    * best, unclear.
    *//* If png_set_filler is in action then fake the output color type to include
    * an alpha channel where appropriate.
    *//* Plus the extra stuff we need for the transform tests: *//* And get the output information into the standard_display *//* Update the info structure for these transforms: *//* Now set the list of transforms. *//* not unpacked *//* invalid *//* never called, I want it to crash if it is! *//* next *//* local_use *//* global_use *//* list *//* enable *//* name *//* Static 'end' structure: *//* It's exact ;-) *//* Override this. *//* The error value is increased, at the end, according to the lowest sBIT
    * value seen.  Common sense tells us that the intermediate integer
    * representations are no more accurate than +/- 0.5 in the integral values,
    * the sBIT allows the implementation to be worse than this.  In addition the
    * PNG specification actually permits any error within the range (-1..+1),
    * but that is ignored here.  Instead the final digitized value is compared,
    * below to the digitized value of the error limits - this has the net effect
    * of allowing (almost) +/-1 in the output value.  It's difficult to see how
    * any algorithm that digitizes intermediate results can be more accurate.
    *//* This is a bit bogus; really the above calculation should use the red_sBIT
    * value, not sample_depth, but because libpng does png_set_shift by just
    * shifting the bits we get errors if we don't do it the same way.
    *//* At the end recalculate the digitized red green and blue values according
    * to the current sample_depth of the pixel.
    *
    * The sample value is simply scaled to the maximum, checking for over
    * and underflow (which can both happen for some image transforms,
    * including simple size scaling, though libpng doesn't do that at present.
    *//* Return NaN as 0: *//* At the end of the list recalculate the output image pixel value from the
 * double precision values set up by the preceding 'mod' calls:
 *//* Three functions to end the list: *//* Set gAMA and cHRM separately. *//* Set up the png_modifier '_current' fields then use these to determine how
    * to add appropriate chunks.
    *//* Set sRGB, cHRM and gAMA transforms as required by the current encoding. *//* Modifications (not necessarily used.) *//* Add this transform to the list and return true if the transform is
    * meaningful for this colour type and bit depth - if false then the
    * transform should have no effect on the image so there's not a lot of
    * point running it.
    *//* Then a transform that takes an input pixel in one PNG format or another
    * and modifies it by a pngvalid implementation of the transform (thus
    * duplicating the libpng intent without, we hope, duplicating the bugs
    * in the libpng implementation!)  The png_structp is solely to allow error
    * reporting via png_error and png_warning.
    *//* And a callback to set the transform on the current png_read_struct:
    *//* A single transform for the image, expressed as a series of function
    * callbacks and some space for values.
    *
    * First a callback to add any required modifications to the png_modifier;
    * this gets called just before the modifier is set up for read.
    *//* The next transform in the list, each transform must call its own next
    * transform after it has processed the pixel successfully.
    *//* The local count of the number of times this transform has been set. *//* The global count of the number of times this transform has been set on an
    * image.
    *//* The global list of transforms; read only. *//* Each transform can be disabled from the command line: *//* The name of this transform: a string. *//* transforms that need image_pixel_add_alpha *//* The error in the alpha is zero and the sBIT value comes from the
       * original sBIT data (actually it will always be the original bit depth).
       *//* Again, check the exact input values, not the current transformed
             * value!
             *//* Check the input, original, channel value here against the
             * original tRNS gray chunk valie.
             *//* After 1.7 the expansion of bit depth only happens if there is a
             * tRNS chunk to expand at this point.
             *//* Add an alpha channel; this will import the tRNS information because tRNS is
 * not valid in an alpha image.  The bit depth will invariably be set to at
 * least 8 prior to 1.7.0.  Palette images will be converted to alpha (using
 * the above API).  With png_set_background the alpha channel is never expanded
 * but this routine is used by pngvalid to simplify code; 'for_background'
 * records this.
 *//* The bit depth of the row changes at this point too (notice that this is
       * the row format, not the sample depth, which is separate.)
       *//* Convert a palette image to an rgb image.  This necessarily converts the tRNS
 * chunk at the same time, because the tRNS will be in palette form.  The way
 * palette validation works means that the original palette is never updated,
 * instead the image_pixel value from the row contains the RGB of the
 * corresponding palette entry and *this* is updated.  Consequently this routine
 * only needs to change the colour type information.
 *//* Store the input information for use in the transforms - these will
    * modify the information.
    *//* Calculate the scaled values, these are simply the values divided by
    * 'max' and the error is initialized to the double precision epsilon value
    * from the header file.

    * Note that this currently assumes a simple palette where entry x has colour

    *//*from pngvalid transform of input*//* Initialize the structure for the next pixel - call this before doing any
 * transforms and call it for each pixel since all the fields may need to be
 * reset.
 *//* Shared utility function, see below. *//* For checking the code calculates double precision floating point values
    * along with an error value, accumulated from the transforms.  Because an
    * sBIT setting allows larger error bounds (indeed, by the spec, apparently
    * up to just less than +/-1 in the scaled value) the *lowest* sBIT for each
    * channel is stored.  This sBIT value is folded in to the stored error value
    * at the end of the application of the transforms to the pixel.
    *
    * If sig_bits is set above the red, green, blue and alpha values have been
    * scaled so they only contain the significant bits of the component values.

            * read/write errors, which is unlikely), so this detects errors in

            *//* First test all the 'size' images against the sequential

 * The technique adopted is to reinvent part of what Dijkstra termed a

 * that a nested function definition can access the local (C auto) variables of
 * the functions that contain its definition.  In fact C provides the first
 * pointer (the local variables - the stack frame pointer) and the last (the
 * global variables - the BCPL global vector typically implemented as global
 * addresses), this code requires one more pointer to make the display - the
 * local variables (and function call parameters) of the function that actually
 * invokes either the progressive or sequential reader.
 *
 * Perhaps confusingly this technique is confounded with classes - the
 * 'standard_display' defined here is sub-classed as the 'gamma_display' below.
 * A gamma_display is a standard_display, taking advantage of the ANSI-C
 * requirement that the pointer to the first member of a structure must be the
 * same as the pointer to the structure.  This allows us to reuse standard_
 * functions in the gamma test code; something that could not be done with
 * nested functions!

          *//* Calculate the bit size, divide by 8 to get the byte size - this won't
       * overflow because we know the w values are all small enough even for

    * bits of the byte.
    *//* the following ensures bits are set in small images: *//* height is in the range 1 to 16, so: *//* Build a single row for the 'size' test images; this fills in only the

 *//* Use next_format to enumerate all the combinations we test, including

 * that test odd sizes along with the libpng interlace handling.
 *//* The inverse of the above, 'row' is part of row 'y' of the output image,

 * API to determine this prior to 1.5, so we need an inquiry function:
 *//* bit_depth == 16 *//*RGB*//* makes unset fields random *//* To make this useful the tRNS color needs to match at least one pixel.
    * Random values are fine for gray, including the 16-bit case where we know
    * that the test image contains all the gray values.  For RGB we need more
    * method as only 65536 different RGB values are generated.
    *//*color*//* Fill in the remainder with a detectable value: *//* Set all the entries, but skip trailing opaque entries *//* Just in case fill in the rest with detectable values: *//* Set all entries to detect overread errors. *//* TODO: the png_structp here can probably be 'const' in the future *//* Initialize a standard palette on a write stream.  The 'do_tRNS' argument
 * indicates whether or not to also set the tRNS chunk.
 *//* 'values' contains 256 ARGB values, but we only need 'npalette'.
       * 'npalette' will always be a power of 2: 2, 4, 16 or 256.  In the low
       * bit depth cases select colors at random, else it is difficult to have
       * a set of low bit depth palette test with any chance of a reasonable
       * range of colors.  Do this by randomly permuting values into the low
       * 'npalette' entries using an XOR mask generated here.  This also
       * permutes the npalette == 256 case in a potentially useful way (there is
       * no relationship between palette index and the color value therein!)
       *//* no transparency/tRNS chunk *//* Fill in the alpha values in the first byte.  Just use all possible values
    * (0..255) in an apparently random order:
    *//* Finally add 192 colors at random - don't worry about matches to things we
    * already have, chance is less than 1/65536.  Don't worry about grays,
    * chance is the same, so we get a duplicate or extra gray less than 1 time
    * in 170.
    *//*but not white*//*need these*//*got black*//* Then add 62 grays (one quarter of the remaining 256 slots). *//* Always put in black and white plus the six primary and secondary colors.
    *//* Make a 'standard' palette.  Because there are only 256 entries in a palette
 * (maximum) this actually makes a random palette in the hope that enough tests
 * will catch enough errors.  (Note that the same palette isn't produced every
 * time for the same test - it depends on what previous tests have been run -
 * but a given set of arguments to pngvalid will always produce the same palette
 * at the same test!  This is why pseudo-random number generators are useful for
 * testing.)
 *
 * The store must be open for write when this is called, otherwise an internal
 * error will occur.  This routine contains its own magic number seed, so the
 * palettes generated don't change if there are intervening errors (changing the
 * calls to the store_mark seed.)
 *//* There are two basic forms of standard images.  Those which attempt to have
 * all the possible pixel values (not possible for 16bpp images, but a range of
 * values are produced) and those which have a range of image sizes.  The former
 * are used for testing transforms, in particular gamma correction and bit
 * reduction and increase.  The latter are reserved for testing the behavior of
 * libpng with respect to 'odd' image sizes - particularly small images where
 * rows become 1 byte and interlace passes disappear.
 *
 * The first, most useful, set are the 'transform' images, the second set of
 * small images are the 'size' images.
 *
 * The transform files are constructed with rows which fit into a 1024 byte row
 * buffer.  This makes allocation easier below.  Further regardless of the file
 * format every row has 128 pixels (giving 1024 bytes for 64bpp formats).
 *
 * Files are stored with no gAMA or sBIT chunks, with a PLTE only when needed
 * and with an ID derived from the colour type, bit depth and interlace type
 * as above (FILEID).  The width (128) and height (variable) are not stored in
 * the FILEID - instead the fields are set to 0, indicating a transform file.
 *
 * The size files ar constructed with rows a maximum of 128 bytes wide, allowing
 * a maximum width of 16 pixels (for the 64bpp case.)  They also have a maximum
 * height of 16 rows.  The width and height are stored in the FILEID and, being
 * non-zero, indicate a size file.
 *
 * Because the PNG filter code is typically the largest CPU consumer within
 * libpng itself there is a tendency to attempt to optimize it.  This results in
 * special case code which needs to be validated.  To cause this to happen the
 * 'size' images are made to use each possible filter, in so far as this is
 * possible for smaller images.
 *
 * For palette image (colour type 3) multiple transform images are stored with
 * the same bit depth to allow testing of more colour combinations -
 * particularly important for testing the gamma code because libpng uses a
 * different code path for palette images.  For size images a single palette is
 * used.
 *//* Standard files - write and save standard files. *//***************************** STANDARD PNG FILES *****************************//* do nothing *//* Remove the sBIT chunk *//* if valid, else *delete* sRGB chunks *//* As above, ignore add and just make a new chunk *//* Chromaticities (in fixed point): *//* Original end points: *//* As with gAMA this just adds the required cHRM chunk to the buffer. *//* This simply dumps the given gamma value into the buffer. *//* Standard modifications to add chunks.  These do not require the _SUPPORTED
 * macros because the chunks can be there regardless of whether this specific
 * libpng supports them.
 *//******************************** MODIFICATIONS *******************************//* Do this first so that the modifier fields are cleared even if an error

    * file!)
    *//* Check for EOF: *//* Check that this number of bytes are available (in the current buffer.)
       * (This doesn't quite work - the modifier might delete a chunk; unlikely
       * but possible, it doesn't happen at present because the modifier only
       * adds chunks to standard images.)
       *//* Generate 15 more bits of stuff: *//* This is another Horowitz and Hill random noise generator.  In this case
    * the aim is to stress the progressive reader with truly horrible variable

 * assumption below that the first encoding in the list is the one for sRGB.
 *//* Linear, only in the 16 bit case *//* The gammas[] array is an array of screen gammas, not encoding gammas,

    *//* The following must be called before anything else to get the encoding set up
 * on the modifier.  In particular it must be called before the transform init
 * functions are called.
 *//* These only become value after IHDR is read: *//* The following must be set in the next run.  In particular
    * test_uses_encodings must be set in the _ini function of each transform

    *//* Not exhaustive - choose an encoding at random; generate a number in

          *//* This will stop the repeat *//* Some transform is encoding dependent *//* Else something needs the current encoding again. *//* (4) encodings with gamma == 1.0 *//* The following test only works after the first time through the
       * png_modifier code because 'bit_depth' is set when the IHDR is read.
       * modifier_reset, below, preserves the setting until after it has called

 * 3) A color space from the encodings array with the corresponding gamma.
 * 4) The same, but with gamma 1.0 (only really useful with 16 bit calculations)
 *
 * The iterator selects these in turn, the randomizer selects one at random,
 * which is used depends on the setting of the 'test_exhaustive' flag.  Notice
 * that this function changes the colour space encoding so it must only be
 * called on completion of the previous test.  This is what 'modifier_reset'
 * does, below.
 *
 * After the function has been called the 'repeat' flag will still be set; the
 * caller of modifier_reset must reset it at the start of each run of the test!
 *//* Chunk was removed *//* Chunk was added *//* Chunk was modified *//* If the following is set to PLTE, IDAT or IEND and the chunk has not been
    * found and modified (and there is a modify_fn) the modify_fn will be called
    * to add the chunk before the relevant chunk.
    *//* If the following is NULL all matching chunks will be removed: *//* One modification structure must be provided for each chunk to be modified (in
 * fact more than one can be provided if multiple separate changes are desired
 * for a single chunk.)  Modifications include adding a new chunk when a
 * suitable chunk does not exist.
 *
 * The caller of modify_fn will reset the CRC of the chunk and record 'modified'
 * or 'added' as appropriate if the modify_fn returns 1 (true).  If the
 * modify_fn is NULL the chunk is simply removed.
 *//* This complements the above by providing the appropriate quantization for the
 * final value.  Normally this would just be quantization to an integral value,
 * but in the 8 bit calculation case it's actually quantization to a multiple of
 * 257!
 *//* This is the case where the value was calculated at 8-bit precision then

 *//* There is a serious error in the 2 and 4 bit grayscale transform because

 * saved files.  This does not delete the store itself.
 *//* Both the create APIs can return NULL if used in their default mode
    * (because there is no other way of handling an error because the jmp_buf
    * by default is stored in png_struct and that has not been allocated!)
    * However, given that store_error works correctly in these circumstances
    * we don't ever expect NULL in this program.
    *//* Set the name for png_error *//* The main interface for reading a saved file - pass the id number of the file
 * to retrieve.  Ids must be unique or the earlier file will be hidden.  The API
 * returns a png_struct and, optionally, a png_info.  Both of these will be
 * destroyed by store_read_reset above.
 *//* just a cache *//* Always do this to be safe. *//* error already output: continue *//* Cleanup when finished reading (either due to error or in the success case).
 * This routine exists even when there is no read support to make the code
 * tidier (avoid a mass of ifdefs) and so easier to maintain.
 *//* Don't do the slow memory checks if doing a speed test, also if user
       * memory is not supported we can't do it anyway.
       *//* The following is the main write function, it returns a png_struct and,
 * optionally, a png_info suitable for writiing a new PNG file.  Use
 * store_storefile above to record this file after it has been written.  The
 * returned libpng structures as destroyed by store_write_reset above.
 *//* And make sure that all the memory has been freed - this will output
    * spurious errors in the case of memory corruption above, but this is safe.
    *//* memory corruption: continue. *//* Cleanup when aborting a write or after storing the new file. *//* Setup functions. *//* PNG_USER_MEM_SUPPORTED *//* Unlink this entry, *test == this. *//* First check that this 'memory' really is valid memory - it must be in the
    * pool list.  If it is, use the shared memory_free function to free it.
    *//* Because libpng calls store_free with a dummy png_struct when deleting
    * png_struct or png_info via png_destroy_struct_2 it is necessary to check
    * the passed in png_structp to ensure it is valid, and not pass it to
    * png_error if it is not.
    *//* is_error *//* NOTE: the PNG user malloc function cannot use the png_ptr it is passed
       * other than to retrieve the allocation pointer!  libpng calls the
       * store_malloc callback in two basic cases:
       *
       * 1) From png_malloc; png_malloc will do a png_error itself if NULL is
       *    returned.
       * 2) From png_struct or png_info structure creation; png_malloc is
       *    to return so cleanup can be performed.
       *
       * To handle this store_malloc can log a message, but can't do anything
       * else.
       *//* The memory callbacks: *//* Get a new mark too. *//* unexpected internal error *//* And reset the other fields too for the next time. *//* The NULL means this will always return, even if the memory is
          * corrupted.
          *//* Finally give the library a chance to find problems too: *//* It should be safe to read the size field now. *//* Note that pp may be NULL (see store_pool_delete below), the caller has
    * found 'memory' in pool->list *and* unlinked this entry, so this is a valid
    * pointer (for sure), but the contents may have been trashed.
    *//* error *//* Else we have to do it ourselves.  png_error eventually calls store_log,
    * above.  store_log accepts a NULL png_structp - it just changes what gets
    * output by store_message.
    *//* Handle a fatal error in memory allocation.  This calls png_error if the
 * libpng struct is non-NULL, else it outputs a message and returns.  This means
 * that a memory problem while libpng is running will abort (png_error) the
 * handling of particular file while one in cleanup (after the destroy of the
 * struct has returned) will simply keep going and free (or attempt to free)
 * all the memory.
 *//* ID marker *//* Size of memory allocated *//* Singly linked list *//* Originating pool *//* A store_memory is simply the header for an allocated block of memory.  The
 * pointer returned to libpng is just after the end of the header block, the
 * allocated memory is followed by a second copy of the 'mark'.
 *//***************************** MEMORY MANAGEMENT*** ***************************//* The result may be null if there is no palette. *//* This is an internal error (the call has been made outside a read
    * operation.)
    *//* This function can only return NULL if called with '0'! *//* The caller must fill this in: *//* space left *//* !IDAT *//* Check for end of chunk and end-of-file; don't try to read a new
             * chunk header at this point unless instructed to do so by 'min'.
             *//* Return chunk bytes, including the CRC *//* Return the header *//* If there is still some pending IDAT data after the IDAT chunks have
          * been processed there is a problem:
          *//* 4..1 *//* IDAT crc *//* skip the input CRC *//* I.e not the CRC *//* IDAT_pos == IDAT_len *//* Ie: crc32(0UL, "IDAT", 4) *//* zero bytes may occur *//* Middle of IDATs, use 'random' to determine the number of bits
                * to use in the IDAT length.
                *//* Read the next chunk *//* End of IDATs, skip the CRC to make the code above load the
                   * next chunk header next time round.
                   *//* Output another 0 length IDAT *//* The only option here is to add a zero length IDAT, this
                * happens 25% of the time.  Because of the check above
                * chunklen-4U-chunkpos must be zero, we just need to skip the
                * CRC now.
                *//* The last (IDAT) chunk should be positioned at the CRC now: *//* all IDAT data read *//* 1..IDAT_size bytes *//* 1 byte *//* 0 bytes *//* First IDAT *//* Make a new IDAT chunk, if IDAT_len is 0 this is the first IDAT,
             * if IDAT_size is 0 this is the end.  At present this is set up
             * using a random number so that there is a 25% chance before
             * the start of the first IDAT chunk being 0 length.
             *//* The IDAT headers are constructed here; skip the input header. *//* Position read so far *//* Read the header of the next chunk: *//* end of last chunk *//* Need separate implementation and callback to allow use of the same code
 * during progressive read, where the io_ptr is set internally by libpng.
 *//* EOF or error *//* Return total bytes available for read. *//* Return the bytes available for read in the current buffer. *//*DOES NOTHING*//* while (st > 0) *//* must be equal *//* bytes left in chunk*//* chunkpos >= 8 *//* for header and CRC *//* Now process the bytes to be written.  Do this in units of the space in the

    * length limited in any case by the amount of data.
    *//* Technically this is legal, but in practice libpng never writes more than
    * the maximum chunk size at once so if it happens something weird has
    * changed inside libpng (probably).
    *//* It's valid *//* Each byte in the chunk type must be in one of the ranges 65..90, 97..122
    * (both inclusive), so:
    *//* skip image first row markers *//* The markers: *//* Then put in the marks. *//* For error checking, the whole buffer is set to 10110010 (0xb2 - 178).
    * This deliberately doesn't match the bits in the size test image which are
    * outside the image; these are set to 0xff (all 1).  To make the row
    * comparison work in the 'size' test case the size rows are pre-initialized
    * to the same value prior to calling 'standard_row'.
    *//* We have an adequate sized image; lay out the rows.  There are 2 bytes at
    * the start and three at the end of each (this ensures that the row
    * alignment starts out odd - 2+1 and changes for larger images on each row.)
    *//* These magic tags are used to detect overwrites above. *//* Called from the startup - ignore the error for the moment. *//* The buffer is deliberately mis-aligned. *//* Return a single row from the correct image. *//* These somewhat odd functions are used when reading an image to ensure that

 *//* warning *//* And finally throw an exception. *//* PNG_NORETURN *//* Functions to use as PNG callbacks. *//* Internal error function, called with a png_store but no libpng stuff. *//* The warning is copied to the error buffer if there are no errors and it is
    * the first warning.  The error is copied to the error buffer if it is the
    * first error (overwriting any prior warnings).
    *//* Log an error or warning - the relevant count is always incremented. *//* Verbose output to the error stream: *//* Neither reading nor writing (or a memory error in struct delete) *//* Writing a file *//* Reading a file *//* Generate an error message (in the given buffer) *//* And save it. *//* Because the IDAT always has zlib header stuff this must be true: *//* Main interface to file storage, after writing a new PNG file (see the API

 *//* 0..32 *//* Return the number of bits in 'num' *//* Use this for random 32 bit values; this function makes sure the result is

 *//* Initialization and cleanup *//* The end of the new PNG file being written. *//* Position in .new *//* Used when writing a new file *//* Write fields *//* Number of rows in a single image *//* Used when re-chunking IDAT chunks *//* Row size of the image(s) *//* Size of this buffer *//* Buffer for reading interlaced images *//* Position in *next *//* Set when reading *//* Used to read a saved file *//* Read fields *//* Cache of the file store value *//* Accumulated IDAT size in .new *//* Position in chunk *//* Type of chunk (valid if chunkpos >= 4) *//* Length of chunk+overhead (chunkpos >= 8) *//* Share fields *//* Name of test *//* setting (unset,invalid,on,off) *//* option number, 0..30 *//* number of options below: *//* used as a temporary flag *//* use progressive read *//* For cexcept.h exception handling - simply store one of these;

 *//*************************** BASIC PNG FILE WRITING ***************************//* Return the index of the changed byte. *//* From libpng-1.5.6 the overwrite should be fixed, so compare the trailing
    * bits too:
    *//* There are, but they may not be significant, remove the bits

       *//* Ok, any differences? *//* Compare pixels - they are assumed to start at the first byte in the
 * given buffers.
 *//* Copy a complete row of pixels, taking into account potential partial
 * bytes at the end.
 *//* One or more bytes *//* Don't rely on << or >> supporting '0' here, just in case: *//* The following read the entire pixels and clears the extra: *//* Mask to select the location of the copied pixel: *//* Sub-byte *//* Assume we can multiply by 'size' without overflow because we are
    * just working in a single buffer.
    *//* Copy a single pixel, of a given size, from one buffer to another -
 * while this is basically bit addressed there is an implicit assumption
 * that pixels 8 or more bits in size are byte aligned and that pixels
 * do not otherwise cross byte boundaries.  (This is, so far as I know,
 * universally true in bitmap computer graphics.  [JCB 20101212])
 *
 * NOTE: The to and from buffers may be the same.
 *//* Less than 8 bits per sample.  By default PNG has the big end of
    * the egg on the left of the screen, but if littleendian is set
    * then the big end is on the right.
    *//* Return the sample from the row as an integer. *//* Multiple channels; select one: *//* Alpha channel *//* !palette *//* Find a sample index for the desired sample: *//* Move to the next color type, or return 0 at the end. *//* Palette images are restricted to 8 bit depth *//* No: next bit depth *//*PALETTE*//*GRAY*//* Add multiple palettes for colour type 3, one image with tRNS
       * and one without for other non-alpha formats:

 *//* Convenience API and defines to list valid formats.  Note that 16 bit read and

 * 16 bit image to test!)
 *//* must have a palette *//* Utility to construct a standard name for a standard image. *//* A numeric ID based on PNG file characteristics.  The 'do_interlace' field
 * simply records whether pngvalid did the interlace itself or whether it
 * was done by libpng.  Width and height must be less than 256.  'palette' is an
 * index of the palette to use for formats with a palette otherwise a boolean
 * indicating if a tRNS chunk was generated.

 *//* Convert a double precision value to fixed point. *//* Error handling is particularly problematic in production code - error
 * handlers often themselves have bugs which lead to programs that detect

 * common class of errors in error handlers - attempting to format error or

 *//******************************* UTILITIES ************************************//* !GNUC broken versions *//* For the moment just do it always; all versions of GCC seem to be broken: *//* GCC BUG 66447 (https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=66447) requires

*//* __asm__ ("xyz") is used throughout the headers to rename functions
   at the assembly language level.  This is wrapped by the __REDIRECT
   macro, in order to support compilers that can do this some other
   way.  When compilers don't support asm-names at all, we have to do
   preprocessor tricks instead (which don't have exactly the right
   semantics, but it's the best we can do).

   Example:
   int __REDIRECT(setpgrp, (__pid_t pid, __pid_t pgrp), setpgid); *//* Some other non-C99 compiler.  Approximate with [1].  *//* Pre-2.97 GCC did not support C99 flexible arrays but did have

   (e.g. only if they won't affect sizeof()) should test
   #if __glibc_c99_flexarr_available.  *//* Fortify support.  *//* C++ needs to know that types and declarations are C, not C++.  *//* This is not a typedef so `const __ptr_t' does the right thing.  *//* For these things, GCC behaves the ANSI way normally,
   and the non-ANSI way under -traditional.  *//* These two macros are not used in glibc anymore.  They are kept here
   only because some other projects expect the macros to be defined.  *//* Compilers that are not clang may object to
       #if defined __clang__ && __has_extension(...)
   even though they do not need to evaluate the right-hand side of the &&.  *//* No inline functions.  *//* Not GCC.  *//* GCC can always grok prototypes.  For C++ programs we add throw()
   to help it optimize the function calls.  But this works only with
   gcc 2.8.x and egcs.  For gcc 3.2 and up we even mark C functions
   as non-throwing using a function attribute since programs can use
   the -fexceptions options for C code as well.  *//* All functions, except those with callbacks or those that
   synchronize memory, are leaf functions.  *//* Some user header file might have defined this before.  *//* The GNU libc does not support any K&R compilers or the traditional mode

   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  *//* Largest integral types.  *//* quad_t is also 64 bits.  *//* Smallest types with at least a given width.  *//* Fixed-size types, underlying types depend on word size and compiler.  *//* Convenience types.  *//*
 * Never include this file directly; use <sys/types.h> instead.
 *//* bits/types.h -- definitions of __*_t types underlying *_t types.

   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_BARRIER_T     - size of pthread_barrier_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_T - size of pthread_barrierattr_t.

   The additional macro defines any constraint for the lock alignment
   inside the thread structures:

   __LOCK_ALIGNMENT - for internal lock/futex usage.

   Same idea but for the once locking primitive:

   __ONCE_ALIGNMENT - for pthread_once_t/once_flag definition.  *//* Common threading primitives definitions for both POSIX and C11.

   arguments in ARGV (ARGC of them, minus the program name) for
   options given in OPTS.

   Return the option character from OPTS just read.  Return -1 when
   there are no more options.  For unrecognized options, or options
   missing arguments, 'optopt' is set to the option letter, and '?' is
   returned.

   The OPTS string is a list of characters which are recognized option
   letters, optionally followed by colons, specifying that that letter
   takes an argument, to be placed in 'optarg'.

   If a letter in OPTS is followed by two colons, its argument is
   optional.  This behavior is specific to the GNU 'getopt'.

   The argument '--' causes premature termination of argument
   scanning, explicitly telling 'getopt' that there are no more
   options.

   If OPTS begins with '-', then non-option arguments are treated as
   arguments to the option '\1'.  This behavior is specific to the GNU
   'getopt'.  If OPTS begins with '+', or POSIXLY_CORRECT is set in
   the environment, then do not permute arguments.

   For standards compliance, the 'argv' argument has the type
   char *const *, but this is inaccurate; if argument permutation is
   enabled, the argv array (not the strings it points to) must be
   writable.  *//* Set to an option character which was unrecognized.  *//* Callers store zero here to inhibit the error message 'getopt' prints
   for unrecognized options.  *//* Index in ARGV of the next element to be scanned.
   This is used for communication to and from the caller
   and for communication between successive calls to 'getopt'.

   On entry to 'getopt', zero means this is the first call; initialize.

   When 'getopt' returns -1, this is the index of the first of the
   non-option elements that the caller should itself scan.

   Otherwise, 'optind' communicates from one call to the next
   how much of ARGV has been scanned so far.  *//* For communication from 'getopt' to the caller.
   When 'getopt' finds an option that takes an argument,
   the argument value is returned here.
   Also, when 'ordering' is RETURN_IN_ORDER,
   each non-option ARGV-element is returned here.  *//* This header should not be used directly; include getopt.h or
   unistd.h instead.  Unlike most bits headers, it does not have
   a protective #error, because the guard macro for getopt.h in
   gnulib is not fixed.  *//* Declarations for getopt (basic, portable features only).

 * Last changed in libpng 1.6.18 [July 23, 2015]
 *
 * This code is released under the libpng license.
 * For conditions of distribution and use, see the disclaimer
 * and license in png.h
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     png-fix-itxt.exe < bad.png > good.png
 *
 * Fixes a PNG file written with libpng-1.6.0 or 1.6.1 that has one or more
 * uncompressed iTXt chunks.  Assumes that the actual length is greater
 * than or equal to the value in the length byte, and that the CRC is
 * correct for the actual length.  This program hunts for the CRC and
 * adjusts the length byte accordingly.  It is not an error to process a
 * PNG file that has no iTXt chunks or one that has valid iTXt chunks;
 * such files will simply be copied.
 *
 * Requires zlib (for crc32 and Z_NULL); build with
 *
 *     gcc -O -o png-fix-itxt png-fix-itxt.c -lz
 *
 * If you need to handle iTXt chunks larger than 500000 kbytes you must
 * rebuild png-fix-itxt with a larger values of MAX_LENGTH (or a smaller value
 * if you know you will never encounter such huge iTXt chunks).

       * a chunk control structure and sets the file length/type/data_pos fields
       * for the *NEXT* chunk header.
       *
       * NOTE: at an IDAT any following IDAT chunks will also be read and the
       * next_ fields will refer to the chunk after the last IDAT.
       *
       * NOTE: read_chunk only returns when it has read a chunk that must now be
       * written.

          * use the checks in process_chunk, but that seems unnecessary.)
          *//* Else write it (this is the initialization of write_count, prior to
          * this it contains CLEAR garbage.)
          *//* The callback always reads ahead by 8 bytes - the signature or chunk header
    * - these bytes are stored in chunk_length and chunk_type.  This block is
    * executed once for the signature and once for the first chunk right at the

    *//* IEND *//* Adjust the read count back to the correct value for this

    * of the chunk data (without processing it in any way) to check that it is
    * all there and calculate the CRC.
    *//* After IEND file::type is set to 0, if libpng attempts to read
    * more data at this point this is a bug in libpng.
    *//* On entry file::data_pos must be set to the position of the first byte
    * of the chunk data *and* the input file must be at this position.  This
    * routine (via process_chunk) instantiates a chunk or IDAT control structure
    * based on file::length and file::type and also resets these fields and
    * file::data_pos for the chunk after this one.  For an IDAT chunk the whole
    * stream of IDATs will be read, until something other than an IDAT is
    * encountered, and the file fields will be set for the chunk after the end
    * of the stream of IDATs.
    *
    * For IEND the file::type field will be set to 0, and nothing beyond the end
    * of the IEND chunk will have been read.
    *//* Control gets to here if when 0x7fffffff bytes (plus 8) have been read,
       * ok, treat this as a damaged stream too:
       *//* This catches up with the circular buffer which gets filled above
          * while checking a chunk header.  This code is slightly tricky - if
          * the chunk_type is IEND the buffer will never be used, if it is not
          * the code will always read ahead exactly 8 bytes and pass this on to
          * process_chunk.  So the invariant that IEND leaves the file position
          * after the IEND CRC and other chunk leave it after the *next* chunk
          * header is not broken.
          *//* Not valid, keep going. *//* Examine the 8 bytes for a valid chunk header. *//* or, nused &= 7 ;-) *//* Prevent overflow *//* Need 8 bytes *//* A match on the CRC; for IEND this is sufficient, but for anything
             * else expect a following chunk header.
             *//* Ignore the recorded chunk length, proceed through the data looking for
       * a leading sequence of bytes that match the CRC in the following four
       * bytes.  Each time a match is found check the next 8 bytes for a valid

       *//* else completely truncated *//* Return to the start of the chunk data *//* The stream seems to be messed up, attempt to resync from the current chunk

    *//* Read a 32-bit value from an 8-byte circular buffer (used only below).
    *//* This is the generic code to skip the current chunk; simply jump to the
    * next one.
    *//* Control reaches this point if the chunk must be skipped.  For chunks other
    * than IDAT this means that the zlib compressed data is fatally damanged and
    * the chunk will not be passed to libpng.  For IDAT it means that the end of
    * the IDAT stream has not yet been reached and we must handle the next
    * (IDAT) chunk.  If the LZ data in an IDAT stream cannot be read 'stop' must
    * be used to halt parsing of the PNG.
    *//* First pass: *//* Ancillary chunks that require further processing: *//* This validates all the fields, and calls stop_invalid if
             * there is a problem.
             *//* Read all the IHDR information and validate it. *//* Read this now and update the control structure with the information
          * it contains.  The header is validated completely to ensure this is a
          * PNG.
          *//* Do per-type processing, note that if this code does not return from the
    * function the chunk will be skipped.  The rewrite is cancelled here so that
    * it can be set in the per-chunk processing.
    *//* Record the 'next' information too, now that the original values for
    * this chunk have been copied.  Notice that the IDAT chunks only make a
    * copy of the position of the first chunk, this is fine - process_IDAT does
    * not need the position of this chunk.
    *//* The chunk length must be updated for process_IDAT *//*chunk*//* The chunk may still be skipped if problems are detected in the LZ data,
    * however the LZ data check requires a chunk.  Handle this by instantiating
    * a chunk unless an IDAT is already instantiated (IDAT control structures
    * instantiate their own chunk.)
    *//* Check for other 'skip' cases and handle these; these only apply to
    * ancillary chunks (and not tRNS, which should probably have been a critical
    * chunk.)
    *//* NOTE: this cannot be reached for IEND because it is critical. *//* This will cause an IEND with a bad CRC to stop *//* Ignore the bad CRC  *//* The behavior is set by the 'skip' setting; if it is anything other
       * than SKIP_BAD_CRC ignore the bad CRC and return the chunk, with a
       * corrected CRC and possibly processed, to libpng.  Otherwise skip the
       * chunk, which will result in a fatal error if the chunk is critical.
       *//* The basic structure seems correct but the CRC may not match, in this
    * case assume that it is simply a bad CRC, either wrongly calculated or
    * because of damaged stream data.
    *//* Called when the chunk data has been read, next_length and next_type
    * will be set for the next chunk (or 0 if this is IEND).
    *
    * When this routine returns, chunk_length and chunk_type will be set for the
    * next chunk to write because if a chunk is skipped this return calls back
    * to read_chunk.
    *//* The three routines read_chunk, process_chunk and sync_stream can only be
 * called via a call to read_chunk and only exit at a return from process_chunk.
 * These routines could have been written as one confusing large routine,
 * instead this code relies on the compiler to do tail call elimination.  The
 * possible calls are as follows:
 *
 * read_chunk
 *    -> sync_stream
 *       -> process_chunk
 *    -> process_chunk
 *       -> read_chunk
 *       returns
 *//* The strategy here is to run a regular libpng PNG file read but examine the
 * input data (from the file) before passing it to libpng so as to be aware of
 * the state we expect libpng to be in.  Warning and error callbacks are also
 * intercepted so that they can be quieted and interpreted.  Interpretation
 * depends on a somewhat risky string match for known error messages; let us
 * hope that this can be fixed in the next version of libpng.
 *
 * The control structure is pointed to by the libpng error pointer.  It contains
 * that set of structures which must persist across multiple read callbacks,
 * which is pretty much everything except the 'zlib' control structure.
 *
 * The file structure is instantiated in the caller of the per-file routine, but
 * the per-file routine contains the chunk and IDAT control structures.

    * The caller must have an instantiated (IDAT) control structure and it must

    * and each byte must then be in the range 0-25.
    *//* Remove bit 5 from all but the reserved byte; this means every

    * must be zero, bit 6 must be set and bit 7 zero.
    *//* Bit whacking approach to chunk name validation that is intended to avoid
    * branches.  The cost is that it uses a lot of 32-bit constants, which might
    * be bad on some architectures.
    *//* This is an alternative to the algorithm used in zlib, which requires four
    * separate tables to parallelize the four byte operations, it only works for
    * a CRC of the first four bytes of the stream, but this is what happens in
    * the parser below where length+chunk-name is read and chunk-name used to
    * initialize the CRC.  Notice that the calculation here avoids repeated
    * conditioning (xor with 0xffffffff) by storing the conditioned value.
    *//* The CRC calculated here *IS* conditioned, the corresponding value used by
 * zlib and the result value is obtained by XORing with CRC_INIT, which is also
 * the first value that must be passed in (for the first byte) to crc_one_byte.
 *//* Copied from unreleased 1.7 code.
 *
 * CRC checking uses a local pre-built implementation of the Ethernet CRC32.
 * This is to avoid a function call to the zlib DLL and to optimize the
 * byte-by-byte case.
 *//* Clear an object to a random value. *//* There are thirty-three bits; the next bit in the sequence is bit-33 XOR
    * bit-20.  The top 1 bit is in u1, the bottom 32 are in u0.
    *//* Generate random bytes.  This uses a boring repeatable algorithm and it
 * is implemented here so that it gives the same set of numbers on every
 * architecture.  It's a linear congruential generator (Knuth or Sedgewick
 * "Algorithms") but it comes from the 'feedback taps' table in Horowitz and
 * Hill, "The Art of Electronics" (Pseudo-Random Bit Sequences and Noise
 * Generation.)
